//!
//! The old window put a model list, a download catalogue, four actions and
//! three settings into one 380px column, and Atur's verdict was the correct
//! one: *"why is all click in one slot"*. The answer is that nothing had been
//! given a home, so everything ended up in the same one.
//!
//! This module is that decision, written down as data: four destinations, and
//! for each control, the single page it belongs to. Hermes' `DESIGN.md` calls
//! these *durable destinations* -- "do not hide a distinct product noun inside
//! an unrelated page" -- and that is the rule the tests at the bottom enforce.
//!
//! No Win32 here either. A page is an enum and a control is a number, so the
//! structure of the app can be checked on a machine with no window server.

/// The four destinations.

/// Ordered as they appear in the rail, which is also the order of their
