# Facts that cost time to rediscover

**This is the long form. `/CLAUDE.md` carries a one-line summary of each entry
here and points at this file.** It lived in `CLAUDE.md` until 2026-08-16, when
that file had grown to 3,308 words against its own ~2000-token budget — and a
budget nobody enforces is not a budget. Nothing was dropped in the move: every
sentence below was in `CLAUDE.md` verbatim, and the summary lines there are
lossy on purpose.

**Read this before proposing any optimisation.** Most of the appealing ideas
about this engine have already been tried, and about half of the entries below
are the measurement that killed one.

## ggml

- **ggml aborts** (`GGML_ASSERT`) when its arena is exhausted — no error to
  catch. Size arenas up front. **This also kills a whole test binary**: the 19
  V4-Flash tests each allocate GB-sized arenas and, run in parallel, exhausted
  memory and aborted the process — reported as `process didn't exit
  successfully`, not as a failing test, with every later result lost. They hold
  a shared `heavy()` lock now, so plain `--ignored` works.
- **Every arena must scale with the prefill block.** Fixed-size arenas abort
  once the block grows; ggml asks and dies rather than returning an error.
  **`available` in that message is the pool's total size, not the remainder** —
  read it as the remainder and you go looking at whichever arena was nearly full
  instead of the one that was too small. Divide `needed` by the tensor size
  instead: `56,624,208 ≈ 3 × 18,874,368` said "this arena budgeted one and
  allocated three" immediately. And **`arena_for` doubles its total, which hides
  an undercount until the block grows enough to eat it** — list every tensor a
  branch can allocate, for that branch.
- **ggml `ne[0]` is the fastest dimension.** Reading shapes as row-major
  transposes every matrix and yields confident nonsense.
- **Weights are bound zero-copy** (`no_alloc` + data pointer). A copy would need
  2× the model and not fit.
- **`compute()` re-evaluates the whole ancestor graph.** Calling it per
  intermediate *re-does* the work each time, plus a graph build and threadpool
  cycle. 24 calls per block became 6 — **1.9x**. Invisible on prefill (big
  matmuls bury it), dominant at one token. Compute only before a
  `to_vec_*`/`set_*`.
- **`compute(&t, 0)` runs on ONE thread** — the count is floored at 1, not
  defaulted to all cores. This silently ran every expert matmul
  single-threaded.
- **`flash_attn_ext` does NOT transpose V**, unlike the `mul_mat` attention
  path, and its mask must be **F16 and contiguous**. Both mistakes give fluent
  nonsense, not an error. Mask values are only 0 and -inf, so write the bits
  (`0x0000` / `0xFC00`) rather than converting.
- **`Arc::from(Box<[u8]>)` reallocates and copies** — hand `bind` the `Vec<u8>`
  instead (`WeightBytes` covers any `Deref<Target=[u8]>`); that mistake alone
  cost 12s of a 27s run.

## Convolutions, for the image path

- **`ggml_conv_2d` needs an F16 kernel and aborts on F32.** It goes through
  `im2col` plus a matmul written for half precision. **`ggml_conv_2d_direct`
  does not** — its type assert is commented out in `ggml.c` and it checks only
  that the input-channel dimensions agree, so a VAE's 138 F32 weights can be
  bound as stored instead of converted. Measured, not read: an F32 kernel
  through it gives `[2,4,6,8]` for a 1x1 kernel of 2 over `[1,2,3,4]`.
- **`conv_2d_direct` wanted 17 MB of arena for a 1x1 convolution over four
  values.** Whatever it reserves is not proportional to the work, so an image
  path needs its arena sized by experiment rather than by arithmetic — and an
  exhausted arena aborts the process, so the experiment belongs in an example
  rather than in the test suite.
- **`group_norm` uses population variance.** `(x - mean) / sqrt(var)` with `var`
  over `n`, not `n-1`: for `[1,2,3,4]` that is 1.3416 rather than 1.1547. A
  "roughly right" check does not separate those.
- **The kernel is the first argument, the data the second.** They are the same
  type, so swapping them compiles and returns a differently shaped answer.
- **`ggml_group_norm` normalises and stops — it never applies weight or bias.**
  Diffusers scales and shifts per channel afterwards, so the caller reshapes the
  `[C]` vectors to `[1,1,C,1]` and does it. Leaving that out is finite,
  correctly shaped and wrong: it cost 19.3 dB of the autoencoder's round trip
  (36.09 to 16.77) and nothing else.
- **`ggml_pad` pads at the *far end only*, which is exactly what diffusers
  wants.** `Downsample2D` applies `F.pad(x, (0, 1, 0, 1))` — right and bottom —
  then convolves stride 2 with *no* padding. A symmetric `pad = 1` produces an
  output of the same shape, shifted half a pixel at every level: 14.60 dB
  against 36.09. **The shape matching is what makes this dangerous.**
- **PyTorch's layout and ggml's are the same bytes described backwards.**
  `[OC, IC, KH, KW]` contiguous *is* `ne = [KW, KH, IC, OC]`, and `[N,C,H,W]` is
  `[W,H,C,N]`. So a safetensors conv weight binds with **no transpose**, just a
  reversed shape. Getting it wrong does not produce a bad picture — the
  input-channel assert fires and ggml **aborts**, which is the one failure in
  this area that announces itself.

## Diffusion, where every failure looks like a picture

- **Score a denoiser against a real latent, not against your eyes.** A rectified
  flow model at noise level `sigma` sees `latent*(1-sigma) + noise*sigma` and
  must predict `noise - latent`. Both terms are known if the autoencoder's
  encoder produces the latent, so the answer can be scored by cosine similarity
  with no image involved. **Score it against each term separately**: `cos(N)`
  high with `cos(-latent)` near zero means the model can see the noise and not
  the image, which is the signature of a permuted or out-of-distribution input —
  noise is permutation-invariant and image content is not. That one decomposition
  found two separate bugs that a picture could not have distinguished.
- **`kv_scale` in `stable-diffusion.cpp` is not the attention scale.** Ideogram 4
  passes `1.f / 128.f`, which reads exactly like a scale for head_dim 256. It is
  not: the helper multiplies k and v by it, divides the softmax scale by it, and
  divides the output back out — an F16 overflow guard that cancels. The real
  scale is the textbook `1/sqrt(head_dim)`. Using 1/128 makes the softmax eight
  times too flat, so every token attends to every other about equally: the model
  still reports each token's noise and stops seeing structure.
- **A reference implementation can be missing something the file provides.**
  `flux2-vae.safetensors` carries `bn.running_mean` and `bn.running_var`, 128
  wide — the packed channel count — and `stable-diffusion.cpp` never reads them.
  Normalising the latent with them moved the velocity score from 0.17 to 0.49 at
  sigma 0.3. **Being faithful to the reference is not the same as being right**,
  and the only way to tell them apart is a measurement the reference does not
  make.
- **`rope_interleaved` is a real argument.** Ideogram 4 passes `false`, so
  element `f` rotates with `f + head_dim/2` and not with its neighbour. Adjacent
  pairing scored near-optimal at high noise and collapsed at low noise, for the
  same reason as above.
- **Resolution is part of the architecture.** The same code scored 0.79 at
  256x256 and 0.85 at 512x512 on the identical photograph. A diffusion
  transformer trained at 1024 and up is out of distribution at 256, so a small
  test image is not merely a faster test — it is a different one, and a
  disappointing picture at 256 is not evidence of a bug.

## Graph memory, which is a ceiling until it is not

- **A `Context` arena never reuses anything.** Every tensor in a graph gets its
  own storage and keeps it until the context drops, so a graph pays for every
  intermediate it ever wrote. `ggml_gallocr` plans the graph and shares buffers
  between tensors whose lifetimes do not overlap. On the host path this was worth
  **18x on the autoencoder's decoder and 7x on the denoiser**, bit-identical
  both times — 1024x1024 images went from impossible to ordinary.
  `GraphAllocator::for_cpu` plus `Context::new_no_alloc`.
- **A `no_alloc` context cannot hold a weight.** It still hands out tensor
  structs, graphs and the compute work buffer, but not tensor *data* — so
  copying bytes into one is a segmentation fault rather than an error. Either
  bind weights zero-copy (`set_data_ptr`, which the planner then skips because
  the tensor already has a pointer) or put them in a second, ordinary context.
  ggml is happy to walk a graph whose tensors come from two contexts.
- **The plan owns the buffer the answer lives in.** Dropping the `GraphAllocator`
  frees every tensor's data, so reading the output *after* the planner goes out
  of scope is a use-after-free — which segfaults only sometimes. Read before
  returning.
- **Inputs are written after `alloc`, never before.** Until the plan is
  allocated they have no storage at all.

## Correctness, which fails silently here

- **An autoencoder is checked by round trip, not by looking.** A decoder alone
  can only be judged by what it produces, and a subtly wrong one produces a
  plausible picture. Running the *encoder* too gives a number: the two halves
  are separately trained weights over one shared latent space, so neither can
  compensate for a bug in the other. Three deliberately introduced errors all
  still produced a recognisable image and all three were caught by PSNR.
  **Ablate the check before trusting it** — the same discipline as scoring a
  residency policy against a null.
- **A sweep that checks exit codes is not a test.** Twelve installed models were
  run and all twelve exited 0, which was written down as "twelve of twelve"
  before any output was read. Qwen3.6-27B exits 0 and prints
  `ทัน ทัน ทัน ทัน ทัน ทัน`. Ask for a token the prompt makes obvious —
  `Paris` after "The capital of France is" — and compare *that*.
- **When the reference implementation fails too, the port is not what is
  wrong.** Chaos and llama.cpp agree to five significant figures on every layer
  sum of Qwen3.6-27B and then *both* go NaN at `l_out-5`, where the residual has
  climbed to 1.009e6. llama.cpp's own answer is `333333`. Agreement that exact,
  up to and including the failure, is stronger evidence of a faithful port than
  a clean diff on a model that works — so before blaming this engine, run the
  competitor on the same file.
- **An architecture name is not a shape.** `qwen35` is byte-identical to
  llama.cpp at 24 blocks and nonsense at 64. `VERIFIED_ARCHITECTURES` is
  per-architecture, so the shape needs its own record —
  `catalogue::verified_block_counts` — and a warning that names what was
  actually diffed.
- **A comment asserting a behaviour is not a test of it.** `qwen35.rs` said the
  fused delta-net op broadcasts key heads over value heads on its own. True, as
  it turns out — but only checked after it became the leading suspect for a bug,
  and only checkable at all because a 2:6 head ratio was tried. At the 1:1 ratio
  the 0.8B has, a missing broadcast and a correct one give the same answer.

- **A tensor you read back must be a *root* of the compute, not merely present
  in the graph.** `ggml_build_forward_expand` walks a root's ancestors; a
  *sibling* view of some node is not an ancestor of it. Qwen3.5's attention gate
  is a strided view of the same `attn_q` matmul as q, so a graph rooted at
  `[q, k, v]` never evaluated it and `to_vec_f32` returned the reused scratch
  arena's leftovers. **The symptom was that turning the debug dump on fixed the
  model** — any extra compute changed the leftovers — and bisecting the dump
  pointed three phases away from the fault. If a value crosses back to the host,
  name it as a root.
- **A layer-by-layer diff can pass while the model is wrong.** The `qwen35` port
  matched `llama-eval-callback` on all 24 layers, by value *and* by sum over
  every prompt token — and generated different tokens when the dump was off,
  because the dump's extra computes changed when a buffer was written. **The diff
  and the answer are two measurements, and both have to be taken with the
  instrumentation in the state it will ship in.** Add a run with the debug flag
  *off* to every parity check.
- **A per-layer sum catches what a per-layer value cannot.** llama.cpp's callback
  prints one, and it is the check that matters for a recurrent layer: a state
  carried wrongly leaves token 0 perfect and every later token wrong, so
  comparing first rows alone said a port was correct while the answer was
  garbage.

- A **wrong tokenizer or forward pass produces fluent nonsense**, never a crash.
  Test pieces separately.
- **Missing causal mask → repeated tokens**, not an error. Masked positions need
  `-inf`, not `0`.
- **top_k does not return indices in score order** — look expert weights up by
  index.
- **Router weights must be renormalised** over selected experts only.
- **Nothing in a GGUF records the FFN activation** — a GELU model and a SiLU
  model hold byte-identical tensor sets. The whole Gemma family is GELU and
  everything else here is SiLU; the wrong one is not a missing tensor, not a
  shape error and not a crash, just a model that answers fluently and disagrees
  with llama.cpp from the first token. `gemma2` sat in `VERIFIED_ARCHITECTURES`
  in that state for weeks. **Membership in that list means someone ran the
  reference — loading is not evidence and answering in English is not
  evidence.**
- **Match the reference's *order*, not its algebra, wherever a soft cap is
  involved.** llama.cpp pre-scales Q and passes `scale = 1.0`; ggml folds the
  cap into the scale (`scale /= cap`), so passing the scale instead is the same
  arithmetic and `0.0625f/50f` vs `0.0625f*(1f/50f)` differ by **one ULP**.
  Through `tanh` that flipped Gemma-2's first token and rewrote the whole
  completion. A cap turns a scale into a non-linearity's argument, and then the
  last bit is not decorative.
- **`chaos-run -v` prints the derived hparams** (`attn_scale`, per-layer RoPE
  bases, windowed-layer list). Use it before theorising: a key read under the
  wrong name looks exactly like a key that was absent.
- **Prompt length decides which code paths run.** V4-Flash's compressed
  attention builders are guarded on their caches being non-empty, so the *same
  layer* runs different attention at different lengths: at 2 tokens all 43
  blocks fall back to the Raw path, at 5 CSA fires, at 165 HCA fires, and the
  sparse indexer selects nothing until >2048. A shorter capture can reach
  *further* than a longer one. See `../research/v4flash-compressed-attention.md`.
- **Routing is not bitwise stable across sequence lengths.** At 63 → 64 tokens
  the *same* earlier tokens re-routed ~3% of their selections (net still +6 per
  layer, so nothing was lost) — near-ties in the top-6-of-256 flipping when the
  batch shape changes. Layers 0-2 (token-id routed) were untouched, so it
  arrives through attention. **Mechanism unidentified**: "ggml re-blocks at
  multiples of 64" was the first guess and a 166→212 run crossing 192 showed
  zero churn, so it is not that. A test demanding equal routing across batch
  shapes will fail on correct code.

## Residency and streaming

- **Expert access is a cyclic scan, so recency-based caching is the worst policy
  available.** Layer 0 is always the oldest entry when layer 47 needs room.
  Frequency-gated admission took hit rate 17% → 70% at the same budget.
- **Expert reads are deduplicated per block across the whole batch.** A pass
  reads the *distinct* experts its tokens select, not one slice per selection
  (`read_expert_slices` takes `unique`). Measured distinct experts per layer per
  pass: **6 at one token (3.2 GiB), 39.7 at 17 tokens (21 GiB), 122.8 at 166
  tokens (66 GiB)** — selections per layer grow 10x from 17 to 166 tokens while
  distinct reads only grow 3x. **So a cache's value depends on how many distinct
  experts a step touches, not on how skewed routing is**, and only a KV-cached
  single-token step is small enough for a few GiB to cover.
- **Cache hit rate is not a success metric.** Past ~6 GiB the expert cache
  reaches 71% hits and is the *slowest* configuration measured: cached bytes get
  paged out, so a "hit" is a page fault wearing a disguise. Only tok/s at a
  stated footprint counts.
  - **Partly retracted 2026-08-16**: the *slowest* half does not reproduce on
    Qwen3-30B, where a 2/4/6/8 GiB sweep gives 2.22/2.66/3.45/3.43 tok/s — it
    plateaus at 6 GiB rather than declining, and the default already sits on the
    plateau (`../research/expert-read-overlap-does-not-pay-2026-08-16.md`). The
    headline stands and the mechanism stands; "more cache eventually goes
    backwards" is a V4-Flash observation that was over-generalised.
- **GGUF pads tensor data to `general.alignment` (32), not to a disk sector.**
  So tensors start mid-sector and a conventionally *aligned* buffer can never
  receive a direct transfer — every byte bounces. Skew the destination to
  `file_offset % 4096` instead (`SkewedBuf`): 0.80 → 1.58 GiB/s, 0.09% copied.
- **Concurrent readers need a file handle EACH.** A Windows handle without
  `FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED` is synchronous and the OS serialises reads on it, so N
  threads on one handle hold the drive at queue depth 1. The old "no gain past 4
  readers, the drive does 2.37 GiB/s" was this artefact: same reads, 4 threads,
  **2.01 GiB/s shared vs 2.65 per-handle**, and per-handle beats the "sequential
  ceiling". `Shard` now pools 8 handles.
- **The drive tops out at 2.74 GiB/s and stops climbing at FOUR handles**
  (`chaos-iobench`, 4 MiB scattered slices; 8/16/32 do not improve on it). So
  the 8-handle pool is not the limit — the gap between that and V4-Flash's
  achieved 1.88 GiB/s is the per-block barrier, and nothing can be queued during
  it because the next block's addresses depend on routing it has not computed
  yet.

## Threads

- **Threads are two levers pulling opposite ways, and `-t` reached only one
  architecture.** Generation saturates DRAM and wants **2-4** threads; prefill
  is compute-bound and wants **all** of them (Qwen3-4B: gen 7.64 @2 vs 4.49 @20;
  prefill 47.4 @4 vs 81.5 @20). Hence `-t` *and* `-tb`, picked by the step's
  token count. The old "threads are not the lever" reading came from a sweep
  whose knob was disconnected — `-t` set `CHAOS_THREADS`, which only
  `deepseek4_forward.rs` read, so `-t 1` and `-t 20` gave *bit-identical* phase
  timings. **A disconnected knob is indistinguishable from a flat response;
  check the knob moves something first.** Fixing it was 1.66x/1.69x.
- **V4-Flash needs the same split, and the old "threads are not the lever" note
  was measured too short.** At 5 tokens a V4-Flash prefill is almost all disk,
  so 4/12/20 did cost the same; **at 180 tokens it is 2.24 (4 threads) against
  2.89 (all)**. Generation is the opposite — `-t 4` beat `-t 20` in two
  back-to-back sessions, 0.380/0.296 and 0.196/0.177. **Absolute V4-Flash
  numbers drift a lot with page-cache state; only compare within one session.**
- **The MoE expert path wants ONE thread — 2.4x on Qwen3-30B** (2.88 tok/s at 1
  vs 1.21 at 20; expert compute 2.2s → 5.2s). A layer's graph holds 24
  matrix-vector products of 768x2048; split 20 ways that is ~38 rows per thread
  per barrier, and the threads cost more than the work. **llama.cpp peaks at 4
  threads where we peak at 1**, because ggml parallelises *within* a node and 38
  rows per thread is not worth a barrier. **Closed 2026-08-16 from the other
  side**: parallelise ACROSS experts — N whole subgraphs, one ggml thread each,
  summed in Rust — 1.29x on expert compute and 1.10x end to end, output
  byte-identical. Nothing is gathered, so the ~1.02 GB/token that killed the
  `mul_mat_id` route never appears
  (`../research/parallel-experts-2026-08-16.md`).

## Measurement

- **Profile before optimising a streaming runner.** The largest cost in
  generation was memcpy — slices copied twice per use — not disk and not
  arithmetic. Nothing suggested it until it was timed.
- **A hot set scored on the prompt it was chosen from tells you nothing.** "64
  experts absorb 97.8% of selections" was in-sample on one prompt; out of sample
  it is 53.7%, and 37.5% across subjects against 25% for caching at random.
  Always score a residency policy on data it did not see. Two matching controls
  are cheap and both were missing: a **uniform null at the same sample size**
  (with ~1000 draws over 256 experts, top-64 covers 41% by construction) and a
  **noise ceiling** (resample the same distribution — if cross-prompt sits below
  it, the divergence is real).
- **Statistics computed over `chaos-run`'s output double-count.** Regeneration
  is stateless, so every generated token re-runs prefill and the routing
  histogram counts the same prompt again: chi-square went 1282 → 5464 → 11469
  for 1/4/8 tokens while coverage never moved. Capture with `-n 1`.
- **Do not calibrate on a proxy.** A 150 ms DRAM-saturation benchmark picked
  6/8/12/12/4/6 on six identical runs while the true optimum was 2-4, and its
  spread was worse than the bad default it replaced — a pure read has no
  per-node barrier, a ggml graph does. Tune on real generated tokens instead. A
  proxy corrected until it agrees with the objective *is* the objective,
  measured badly.
- **A counter inside an overlapped path measures the overlap, not the work.**
  The obvious way to price a residency shortfall was to accumulate bytes and
  elapsed time in `prefetch_dense_via`, the funnel every spilled read passes
  through. It reads **0.80 GiB/s** against a swept truth of 2.44, because R2
  overlap runs that prefetch on 2 of 8 handles for the whole duration of a
  block — its wall clock is how long the thread was *occupied*.
  `CHAOS_PREFETCH_OVERLAP=0` reads 1.99 on the same binary. Built, measured,
  reverted; the same shape as the `dense` phase timer reading 0.01 s per token
  while the spill demonstrably costs 0.41 s/GiB.
- **The load rate is not the re-read rate, and the difference is queue depth.**
  `chaos-run` priced a shortfall at `missing / LoadReport::bytes_per_sec()` and
  overstated it by ~1.5x for two years' worth of sessions: the load is
  essentially one stream at 1.6-2.0 GB/s, while the spill comes back across the
  eight-handle pool at 2.4-2.7 GiB/s. What ships re-reads a sample of **the
  spilled tensors themselves** through the same pool — the operation, not a model
  of it. Its sizing had to be measured too: capping each read at 16 MiB swung the
  answer 1.54-2.65 GiB/s, because whether a tensor exceeded the cap changed the
  read size.
- **A kernel benchmark measures the kernel, not the data movement needed to feed
  it.** `chaos-kernelbench` put the batched `mul_mat_id` expert form at 11.17
  GiB/s with 2.86x thread scaling — real, but it binds the model's
  *already-stacked* tensor zero-copy. On the streaming path the selected experts
  are unrelated `Arc<[u8]>`, and making them contiguous costs ~1.02 GB/token,
  which is what the kernel saves. Built, byte-identical output, **1.34 → 1.27
  tok/s, reverted.** The version that pays needs the experts resident.
- **Killing a benchmark's wrapper does not kill the engine, and an orphan is
  invisible in the numbers.** A stopped background script left `llama-completion`
  alive holding **8.98 GiB**; every run after it read 10x slow (V4-Flash
  generation 0.039 against 0.39) and looked exactly like a regression.
  `Get-Process` before trusting a surprising number, and prefer letting a
  comparison finish over stopping it.
- **A competitive claim is not citable until the competitor's exact command line
  and its output are in a doc.** "llama.cpp can't do X" survived days on a
  misattributed error string because nobody ran the opposing command. Run it,
  paste it, flag it.
- **And it needs REPEATS, because the first run of a GPU path is a different
  program from the second.** ggml's Vulkan backend compiles a large shader set
  on first use and the driver persists the pipelines to disk, so run 1 pays
  compilation *inside the timed region*. That published "the card is 0.42x the
  CPU" with a confident causal story about PCIe round trips; the same binary
  then measured 1.49x, then 1.6-1.8x. **Discard the first run.** Three failures
  there, only one of which was the number: a cold-cache run reported as steady
  state, a mechanism asserted rather than measured (1.4 GB moves in under a
  second, against a ten-second gap — the arithmetic contradicted the story and
  nobody checked), and a retraction found *by accident* when a build failed and
  the old binary ran again. **Nothing re-measures a number already written
  down**, so the guard has to be in the harness.

## V4-Flash specifically

- **V4-Flash has no redundancy left to harvest — four probes, four negatives.**
  Experts are 9.1% internally negligible; the expert *bank* is full-rank (a
  rank-512 shared basis holds 20.4% of its energy against **16.6% for random
  noise**, `chaos-spectrum`); the router's tail is not small
  (33.5/20.6/15.0/12.1/10.1/**8.8**%, so 3-of-6 discards 31% of the mass); and a
  pinned hot set scores 37.5% vs 25.0% random. **3.21 GiB/token is what the
  model costs, not an artefact.** Do not re-propose factorisation, contextual
  sparsity, or pinning.
- **The expert matmul is a few percent of a token on V4-Flash, and the
  parallel-experts win does NOT port there.** 3.02 ms per block at 24.7 GiB/s —
  above single-threaded memcpy, i.e. already at DRAM speed. Measured directly
  2026-08-16 by dropping the three routed `mul_mat_id` calls and keeping the
  read: generation **0.388 against 0.370**, block `compute` **0.01s of 0.44** —
  so the whole routed arithmetic is **under 5%** and perfect parallelisation is
  worth at most 1.05x. **A V4-Flash token is 67% expert-slice read, 17% block
  compute, 16% routing.** There is also nothing to gather: `read_expert_slices`
  packs the slices contiguously as it reads them, so this path already runs the
  batched form for free. Compute scales as ~`n^0.49` in the batch, so
  batched/speculative passes are cheaper than a linear model predicts
  (`../research/parallel-experts-do-not-transfer-2026-08-16.md`).
- **Speculative decoding is ~1.4x here, not 2.2x.** The literature assumes the
  verify pass costs what a single-token pass costs; here it costs more, because
  more tokens select more distinct experts (`U(n)≈6·n^0.667`). Below α≈0.75 it
  is a net *loss*, and the optimum draft is short.

## Toolchain

- **Windows: `.cargo/config.toml` sets `link-self-contained=no`.** MSYS2 gcc
  16.1.0 dropped symbols rustup's bundled `crt2.o` still references, so every
  link fails with "undefined reference" on code that compiles. Do not delete it.
- Windows needs the **GNU** Rust toolchain
  (`rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`) plus MSYS2 mingw64 on PATH.
  `[[bin]]` targets set `test = false` — empty harnesses are pointless and Smart
  App Control blocks unsigned fresh binaries.

## The window

Every entry here cost a rebuild and a screenshot. **A GUI is not verified by
compiling**, and three of these were believed fixed before a pixel was measured.

- **Each `run:` in a workflow is its own shell, and a step that emits files
  without checking them will emit nothing for a year.** v0.0.22 was tagged, CI went
  green, and the Release run **failed** — five desktop platforms built, the android
  job died, and the publish job was skipped, so a tag existed with no release
  behind it. The step was "The brand pages, into the APK", running for the first
  time ever (`STATUS.md` had said so: *"--emit-pages is wired into release CI but
  has never run there"*). It does a **host** build of `chaos-serve` because it
  *runs* the binary rather than shipping it, and the `GGML_LIB_DIR` exported for the
  Android cross-build in the previous step **is not set in the next one** — so
  `chaos-arch`'s build.rs panicked with "ggml not found". Two lasting lessons.
  **One**: an `export` does not survive a step boundary, and a job that
  cross-compiles and then wants a host binary needs two ggml builds. **Two**: that
  step wrote two files and never looked at them, which is why nobody noticed it had
  never worked — it now asserts each page is non-empty, contains no `<link>`, and
  carries the font licence. **A tag with no release is worse than no tag**: it
  reads as a shipped version. It was safe to move only because the publish job had
  been skipped, so no asset had ever existed to download — check that before ever
  moving one.
- **CI logs cannot be read from this machine.** `actions/jobs/<id>/logs` redirects
  to `productionresultssa*.blob.core.windows.net`, which does not resolve on this
  network — the same class of restriction as `dl.google.com` 404ing here. So a CI
  failure has to be diagnosed by *reproducing it locally from the workflow's own
  commands*, which is what found the missing `GGML_LIB_DIR` in one try:
  `env -u GGML_LIB_DIR cargo build --release -p chaos-serve --bin chaos-serve`.
- **A corrupt model is indistinguishable from a working one, and nothing checks.**
  Four kinds of broken container were tried. Zero bytes, random bytes and a
  truncated file all fail precisely and exit 1 — they name the byte counts and the
  expected magic. **Four kilobytes of zeros written into the tensor data loads,
  runs, exits 0 and answers fluently**, and differently: "The capital of France
  is" gives *" Paris. The capital of France is Paris"* intact and *" Paris. The
  capital of Germany is Berlin"* corrupt. Both plausible, neither flagged. There is
  **no checksum anywhere** — `chaos_model::download` verifies `looks_like_gguf`,
  which is the magic bytes — so a badly resumed or bit-rotted file keeps a valid
  header and is confidently wrong forever. This is the wrong-forward-pass trap
  arriving through the container instead of the code.
- **A clean EOF and a killed process are different failures, and only one of them
  looked like one.** An SSE reader that returns `Ok` at EOF cannot tell a finished
  answer from a connection that stopped: `[DONE]` is the only evidence the answer
  is whole. A *killed* process sends RST, which surfaces as a read error, so the
  broken path is reachable only by a **graceful** close — which is why the live
  test could not reproduce it and a fake node could. Related, and it cost a wrong
  test twice: **dropping a socket with unread data in its receive queue makes
  Windows send RST rather than FIN**, so a fake server must `shutdown(Write)` and
  then drain if it wants to produce a clean EOF at all.
- **`GetWindowText` on another process's control reads a CAPTION, not its text —
  and an EDIT's text is not its caption.** Called across a process boundary it
  does not send `WM_GETTEXT`; that is documented and deliberate, so a hung target
  cannot hang the caller. The consequence is that every EDIT in the app reads as
  the empty string from any external probe, however full it is, while every
  BUTTON reads correctly — a button's label *is* its caption. **A whole defect was
  reported against this app on the strength of those empty strings** ("the CHAOS
  page arrives blank") and retracted the same day: under `WM_GETTEXT` the same
  three fields held the address, the key and 105 characters of guidance. The
  cruellest part is the confirmation that came with it — a marker written into
  those fields *from outside* survived navigating away and back, which looked
  like proof the app never wrote them. It was not: a cross-process
  `SetWindowTextW` marshals through USER32 and sets the caption, so the probe was
  reading back its own write, on a field the app had filled somewhere the probe
  could not see. **Send `WM_GETTEXT` and fall back to the caption**, which is what
  `run-through.ps1` does now. When an external probe and the source disagree,
  instrument the source before believing the probe.
- **Painting a screen does not cover a child window, and a green run-through is
  not a working window.** `WM_PAINT` returning early — `if !ui.launched {
  paint_launch(...); return; }` — paints the launch screen and nothing else, but
  the controls are real HWNDs and go on showing. `WM_CREATE` ended with
  `show_page(Page::Chat)`, so the installed v0.0.21 opened with the mode knob
  painted *underneath* the chat transcript, its composer, SEND, CLEAR, the four
  rail buttons and STOP: **9 controls on-screen, measured, 0 after the fix.**
  `back_to_knob` hid them correctly on the way out, which is the tell — when one
  of two routes does the hiding, the other one is a bug waiting for a report.
  Two measurement lessons came with it. **`IsWindowVisible` is not "the user can
  see it"**: `layout` parks the pages a mode cannot reach at `(-3200,-3200)` and
  leaves them visible, so read client-rects or you will call correct gating a
  bug, as happened here first time round. And **`scripts/run-through.ps1`
  reported 22 controls exercised and "nothing blocked the window" for an app that
  had never left its launch screen**, because it drives pages by `WM_COMMAND`,
  which goes through neither the rail nor the knob. An instrument that bypasses
  the thing under test will certify it.
- **Never hold a `RefCell` borrow across a call Windows can re-enter.**
  `SendMessageW`, `EnableWindow`, `SetWindowTextW`, `MoveWindow`, `ShowWindow`
  and `SetFocus` can all dispatch `WM_CTLCOLOR*` synchronously, which borrows
  the same cell. Under `panic = "abort"` the double borrow is instant, silent
  process death — no message, no log, no stack. Pull handles and data *out* of
  the borrow, drop it, then talk to Windows. `tests/ui_rules.rs` enforces this
  textually, and found three more instances the day it was written.
- **A combo box's height is the height of its *dropped list*, not of its closed
  box.** Windows sizes the closed control from its own item height and hands
  every remaining pixel to the list. `MoveWindow(combo, x, y, w, ROW_HEIGHT)`
  therefore leaves the list nothing to open into, and clicking the control does
  visibly nothing — no error, no flicker, identical to a dead control. It is
  *not* a population bug: `CB_GETCOUNT` reported three to six items the whole
  time. Measured with `CB_GETDROPPEDCONTROLRECT`: **32 px in v0.0.7, 238 px
  after passing `CONTROL + ROW * VISIBLE`**. The window still lays out correctly
  because the control shrinks itself back to the closed height.
- **`CB_GETDROPPEDCONTROLRECT` measures this from outside the process.** Any
  tool with the window handle can read it, which is how the before-and-after
  above was taken against the *installed* v0.0.7 binary rather than from
  reasoning about a diff.
- **Find controls by id, not by storing handles in the state.** `GetDlgItem`
  needs only the window handle, which can live in an atomic — so no action
  function needs a borrow open in order to locate a control. This removes the
  bug above by construction rather than by discipline.
- **A `thread_local!` is invisible to worker threads.** `notify()` read the UI
  handle from one, saw `None` on every worker, posted nothing, and every
  generated token was received and discarded while the status line said
  "ready". Anything a background thread needs goes in an atomic or a `Mutex`.
- **A read-only `EDIT` silently ignores `EM_REPLACESEL`** — no error, no text.
  Clear `ES_READONLY`, append, set it again.
- **`GetWindowText` returns empty for a control owned by another process**, so
  a cross-process UI test reads every box as empty whether the app works or
  not. This cost an hour and nearly produced a fix for a bug that did not
  exist. `WM_GETTEXT` sent with `SendMessage` *does* work across processes;
  otherwise a screenshot is the evidence.
- **Windows draws the menu bar, and it does not follow dark mode.**
  `DwmSetWindowAttribute(DWMWA_USE_IMMERSIVE_DARK_MODE)` darkens the title bar
  only. `SetPreferredAppMode` (uxtheme ordinal 135, with `FlushMenuThemes` at
  136) is what every dark Win32 app calls; on 10.0.26200 the ordinals resolve,
  the call runs, and the bar still measures `#FFFFFF` — tried both before and
  after window creation. **It was removed rather than shipped as a no-op.**
  Scrollbars *are* fixable: `SetWindowTheme(h, "DarkMode_Explorer", NULL)` on
  each control moves them from `#F0F0F0` to `#171717`, and that call alone is
  sufficient — the app-mode call contributed nothing to it either.
- **Owner-draw is the only way to colour a button or a list selection.** A
  themed push button ignores `WM_CTLCOLORBTN` entirely and the selection bar is
  the system highlight.
- **`ne`-style geometry belongs in one function.** The settings page positions
  its boxes in `layout` and draws their labels in `paint`; two independent walks
  of the same list is how a label lands over the wrong box. One function returns
  the run, both callers use it.
- **Do not do file I/O while painting.** Counting a model's shards in the
  detail panel meant a directory scan per repaint, and the transcript repaints
  on every token. Count it once, in the rescan.
- **`InvalidateRect` on the parent does not repaint owner-drawn children.** They
  redraw only when Windows sends them a `WM_DRAWITEM`, and it only does that for
  a control that is itself invalid. The rail therefore lit each item as it was
  clicked and never un-lit the last one: click all four pages and all four are
  highlighted. Atur reported it as *"the menu options all of them become
  blue"*. Worse through the menu and `Ctrl+1..4`, where no button was clicked at
  all, so the page changed and the rail kept pointing at the old one. Invalidate
  every control whose appearance depends on the state you just changed.
- **A drop-down is exactly as wide as its box unless told otherwise.**
  `CB_SETDROPPEDWIDTH`, measured against the longest label and capped to the
  work area. Without it *"Processor (the GPU is not used here yet)"* opened as
  *"Processor (the GPU is not used her…"* — the list opened, it selected, it
  could not be read, and the report was that the drop-downs did not work.
- **Two walkers over the same layout drift, and the drift is invisible in
  code.** Already written down once for labels over boxes; it recurred with a
  button. `settings_rows` put BROWSE six pixels under the models-folder field
  and `paint_settings` painted that field's note in the same six pixels, so the
  button sat on the sentence explaining the field. One shared step function is
  the fix; there is now `field_extra(id)` and both callers add it.
- **A logo of fine lines needs supersamples, not pixels.** The mark is a sun of
  two dozen one-pixel rays around an eye. At 44px with 4x4 supersampling every
  ray edge landed on one of sixteen grey levels and the whole thing read as
  notched — reported as "low quality logo" twice, at 32px and again at 44px.
  8x8 at 64px is smooth. The rasterisation is cached, so the cost is paid once.
- **A control id that collides with a menu id fails silently and looks like a
  dead button.** `WM_COMMAND` carries both through the same parameter and the
  menu ids are matched first, so numbering a new page from 601 -- where
  `IDM_TRAY_OPEN` and `IDM_TRAY_EXIT` already lived -- made the prompt box mean
  "open the window" and the size drop-down mean **quit the application**.
  Nothing failed to compile. The visible symptom was that DRAW did nothing.
  There was a test for exactly this and it read a **hand-written list of menu
  ids** that nobody had extended; it derives them from the source now.
- **An owner-drawn combo draws from the state, not from the control.**
  `draw_combo` takes its labels from `ui.lists`, so a combo filled only with
  `CB_ADDSTRING` has items that select correctly and paint as blank rows.
- **A new page needs three registrations, and the compiler asks for none of
  them**: its rail button in `SHELL_CONTROLS` or it is never shown, its id in
  `weight_of` or it paints as a push button among washes, and its controls in
  `nav::controls` or they never appear.
- **Making the X hide instead of quit changes what `WM_CLOSE` means
  everywhere.** Every place that posted one in order to end the process now
  merely hides the window. The in-app updater did exactly that: it downloaded
  the installer, started it, posted `WM_CLOSE`, stayed alive, and the installer
  stopped on "cannot write chaos-app.exe" -- after the download, with no window
  on screen. Grep for `WM_CLOSE` when you make that change, and route real exits
  through one function that sets a flag.
- **Closing-to-tray makes single-instance mandatory, not optional.** With the
  window hidden, double-clicking the shortcut is an easy mistake that starts a
  second engine holding a second model's worth of memory, with the first one
  invisible. `FindWindowW` alone is not enough -- between starting and
  registering a class there is a gap where both instances find nothing. A named
  mutex closes it: `CreateMutexW` succeeds either way and `GetLastError` reports
  `ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS`.
- **`Shell_NotifyIcon` needs `cbSize` to match a version of the struct the shell
  knows**, and a wrong one is rejected silently -- no icon, no error. Remove the
  icon on `WM_DESTROY` as well as on the close path, or an icon whose window is
  gone sits in the tray until somebody hovers over it.
- **On Windows 11 a new tray icon goes behind the `^` and there is no API to
  change that.** Do not spend time looking; say so in the manual.
- **A round trip cannot check a convention, and this one cost six hours.** The
  Ideogram 4 denoiser's vertical axis runs **bottom-up**: latent row 0 takes the
  *highest* mRoPE `y`. Every internal check passed while it was wrong --
  `try-orientation` proved the autoencoder does not flip in either direction,
  and the token layout matched the position table -- because a latent from the
  *denoiser* never passes through the encoder, so the mismatch cancels in every
  test that starts from a real image and in none that starts from noise. A
  1024x1024 render at 50 steps came out a perfect, photorealistic portrait,
  upside down.
  **Settle a convention with the velocity harness, not a round trip**: on a real
  photograph at four noise levels, bottom-up beat top-down 12 of 12 --
  `cos(-L)`, whether the model can see the image at all, rose 0.352 -> 0.438 at
  sigma 0.3, and `x0` error fell on every row. `CHAOS_TOPDOWN_Y=1` repeats the
  comparison.
- **Nothing rescues a detailed mark at 16px.** Tried on the title-bar icon:
  averaging the subsamples gives blue mush, taking the maximum gives a solid
  white disc, and every blend between is one or the other. `make-ico.py` already
  renders each size from the vector at its own resolution, which is the correct
  thing to do and is not the problem. **A small icon needs a simplified glyph,
  which is artwork, not filtering** — do not spend another hour on the filter.

- **Ask what a button does when pressed by accident.** The setup's UNINSTALL
  removed a whole install on one click with no confirmation, sitting beside
  UPDATE on the same screen. It shipped through five releases and was found only
  when it destroyed a user's installation. The question costs nothing; not
  asking it cost a user their setup and an evening.
- **A public repository authenticates nothing on read.** `git ls-remote` against
  `aturzone/Chaos` succeeds with a token of forty zeroes, so "git works but the
  API says Bad credentials" is not evidence of a network problem -- it is what a
  **revoked token** looks like. Test with a deliberately wrong credential before
  concluding anything about the network.

## Releasing

- **`git tag -a -F file` deletes every line beginning with `#`.** A tag message
  defaults to `--cleanup=strip`, which removes comment lines, and the release
  workflow builds the release body from the annotation. So Markdown `##`
  headings vanish and the release page becomes one wall of text. Pass
  `--cleanup=verbatim`, and check with `git tag -l --format='%(contents)'` on a
  throwaway tag before pushing the real one — the page is public the moment the
  tag lands.
- **`actions/checkout` does not give you the annotated tag object**, even on a
  tag push with `fetch-depth: 0`: `refs/tags/$TAG` ends up pointing straight at
  the commit. v0.0.10 published its commit message as release notes — trailer
  and all — and `gh release create --notes-from-tag` was blamed for it. **That
  diagnosis was wrong**: there was no annotated tag in the checkout to read, so
  `gh` fell back to the only message it could find, and reading the tag with
  `git` instead failed the same way for the same reason. Fetch it explicitly:
  `git fetch --force origin "refs/tags/$TAG:refs/tags/$TAG"`.
- **Guard it with `git cat-file -t`, not with a non-empty check.** For a
  lightweight tag `%(contents)` silently returns the *commit* message, which is
  the exact failure being guarded against. Only an annotated tag has type `tag`
  — and that guard is what caught the checkout problem on v0.0.11, one release
  after the wrong explanation was written down.
- **Asset names are read by people scanning a release page.** One prefix, one
  version format, platform and architecture on every file. The `.deb` is the
  documented exception: Debian policy wants `name_version_arch.deb`, lower case
  and no `v`, and an installer that will not install is not tidier.
- **A glob in the release workflow outlives the name it was written for.** After
  the archives were renamed `Chaos-*`, a `Get-ChildItem -Filter 'chaos-*'` in the
  installer test would have matched nothing and indexed `[0]` on an empty array
  — in the step that proves the installer works. Grep the workflow for the old
  name whenever an artefact is renamed.

- **A `workflow_dispatch` input that nothing reads is worse than no input**, and
  it looks like a working dry-run mechanism until the day you use it. The `tag`
  input existed, was documented "for a dry run without publishing", and was
  never read: `Package` used `GITHUB_REF_NAME`, which on a branch dispatch is
  the *branch*. A dry run from `ticket/r68-app-ui` therefore built
  `Chaos-ticket/r68-app-ui-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` -- a name with a slash -- so
  `mkdir -p` made a directory, `tar` wrote inside it, and four of five builds
  reported failure having compiled and smoke-tested perfectly.
- **A retired GitHub runner label does not fail, it queues forever.** The Intel
  Mac build was written against `macos-13`, which GitHub retired on 2025-12-08;
  the job sat at "queued" against a pool with no runners while the other four
  went green, and nothing anywhere said why. Fourteen minutes of that with a tag
  waiting is the symptom. `macos-15-intel` is the current Intel image, and
  **Intel macOS ends when it retires in autumn 2027**. Check the label against
  `actions/runner-images` before assuming a queued job is merely slow.
- **Rehearse the release workflow before tagging when the matrix changes.** Two
  new runners (`ubuntu-24.04-arm`, `macos-13`) were added in v0.0.12; a dry run
  proved both build ggml, build all twelve binaries and start them, and it cost
  one dispatch instead of a broken release.

## The installer

- **A running executable cannot delete the directory it lives in, and the
  staged helper needs its parent to be *gone*, not merely finished.** The
  installer copies itself into `bin` so Add/Remove Programs has something to
  launch, which means the normal uninstall runs from inside the folder it is
  removing. It stages a copy in `%TEMP%` and lets that do the work — and the
  parent then showed a message box and only exited when it was dismissed, while
  the helper retried for ten seconds and gave up. **Ten seconds against however
  long somebody takes to read a dialog** is what "uninstall does not work" was.
  Pass the parent's pid, wait on the handle, and let the helper do the talking.
- **`MoveFileEx(.., NULL, MOVEFILE_DELAY_UNTIL_REBOOT)` needs administrator
  rights.** It is the documented way for a running executable to arrange its own
  deletion and it is unavailable to a per-user installer: unelevated it returns
  false and sets error 3. What works is a detached `cmd` that waits and deletes,
  with `ping` as the delay because `timeout` needs a console.
- **`raw_arg`, not `arg`, when the program is `cmd.exe`.** Rust quotes arguments
  by the C runtime's rules and `cmd` parses its command line by its own, so a
  redirection or an `&` arrives quoted and cmd answers "The filename, directory
  name, or volume label syntax is incorrect."
- **The uninstall must remove everything the install wrote, and `version.txt`
  was missed.** The prefix was therefore never empty, `remove_dir` always
  failed, and a stale version file was left claiming Chaos was installed. Found
  on a real machine. One list, `prefix_files`, read by both ends.
- **`UninstallString` needs its arguments.** Without them, clicking Uninstall in
  Windows Settings opens the installer's welcome screen with INSTALL as the
  primary button — the one action the user asked for is the one not offered.
- **Explorer caches an executable's icon by path** and does not re-read a file
  overwritten in place, so an upgrade keeps showing the previous version's icon
  on the taskbar, in the Start Menu and on the shortcut. The file being correct
  is not enough: call `SHChangeNotify(SHCNE_ASSOCCHANGED)` at the end of a copy.
- **An icon resource has to be added per crate.** `cargo:rustc-link-arg-bins`
  applies only to the crate that prints it, so two crates with their own copy of
  the `windres` dance left the other four crates' binaries with the blank
  Windows default — eight of ten executables, for eight releases.

- **`Vec::as_ptr()` on an empty vector is a dangling pointer, and Windows will
  dereference it.** `DrawTextW` with a zero-length buffer took the installer
  down the instant its report reached a blank line: a stack-cookie failure
  (`c0000409`), not an access violation, so it did not even look like a null
  dereference. Guard every text call on `!is_empty()`.
- **A panic inside `extern "system"` never reaches the panic hook.** Unwinding
  out of a non-`C-unwind` function is undefined, so Rust aborts at the boundary
  — the hook does not run, no log is written, and the window simply vanishes.
  A `wndproc` is exactly such a function, so nothing that happens during
  painting can report itself. The only way to find one is to log through it.
- **The Windows Application event log is the last resort and it does help.**
  `Get-EventLog -LogName Application` gave the fastfail code and the faulting
  offset when there was no crash file at all, which is what said "Rust abort"
  rather than "access violation" and ruled out half the candidates.
- **An installer needs a log more than any other program here.** It runs once,
  on a machine that is not yours, and the person running it cannot rerun it
  under a debugger. `%TEMP%\chaos-setup.log` is written a line at a time,
  opened and closed per line so an abort cannot lose a buffered write — and it
  is what found the crash above in one run.
- **Do the work on a worker, not in the message loop.** The old install ran
  inside `WM_COMMAND`, so the window was frozen for its whole duration and said
  nothing about what it was doing. Every step now reports before and after, and
  the list shows which one is in flight.
- **`CreateFontW` never fails.** Ask for a face that is not installed and GDI
  substitutes silently, so a display serif chosen for a wordmark quietly becomes
  the UI font. Select it into a DC and ask `GetTextFaceW` what actually came
  back; `first_available_face` does this.

## Models on disk

- **`CHAOS_MODELS` overrides the models directory, and an inherited one is
  invisible.** A session exported it to a scratchpad under `%TEMP%`, and every
  process launched from that shell — the app, the server, `chaos-pull` — used it
  silently. A 16.8 GB download landed in a temp folder that gets cleaned, and
  the app's INSTALLED list showed a model nobody remembered fetching. Check
  `env | grep CHAOS` before believing where anything is, and unset it in any
  script that downloads.
- **Download progress is the bytes on disk, not the downloader's output.**
  `chaos-pull` resumes with `curl -C -` straight into the final filename, so the
  file size *is* the progress. That survives the child having no console, being
  restarted, or changing its output format — none of which parsing stdout does.
  Count the rate over *this run only*, or a resumed 155 GB container reports an
  absurd rate in its first second.
- **`qwen35` and `qwen35moe` are hybrid architectures**, grouped in llama.cpp
  with `QWEN3NEXT`, `KIMI_LINEAR` and `JAMBA` — `llm_arch_is_hybrid` returns
  true, and `llm_arch_supports_rs_rollback` returns true only for these two.
  They carry recurrent state alongside attention, plus multi-token prediction.
  The IMROPE rope mode that first flagged them is the small part. Running
  Qwen 3.5/3.6 is a hybrid-attention port, not a rope fix, and no amount of
  re-downloading changes that.
- **How much of Qwen3.6 is not attention: three quarters of it.** The container
  states `full_attention_interval 4` over 64 blocks, and llama.cpp's rule is
  `is_recr[i] = (i + 1) % interval != 0` — **48 recurrent layers, 16 attention
  layers**. The recurrent ones are a gated delta net: `attn_qkv` is `[5120,
  10240]` where `10240 = 2 * (16 * 128) + 48 * 128`, i.e. q and k over 16 groups
  and v over 48 heads, all 128 wide, and `ssm_conv1d` is a depthwise causal
  convolution over the whole of it. A KV cache cannot hold that state: it is
  carried and rewritten, not appended.
- **A GGUF states its own length, so a truncated download is provable.** The
  tensor index gives every tensor an offset and a size; the file cannot end
  before the last of them. Shorter is truncated, longer is alignment padding.
  This needs no catalogue and no network — which matters, because a half-written
  container has a *valid header* (the header is written first) and is otherwise
  indistinguishable from a finished one in a list. Three models on the
  development machine were in that state and the app reported all three as ready
  to run.
- **Read the header progressively, not in one 32 MB gulp.** Completeness is
  checked for every model on every rescan. A dense container's header is under a
  megabyte; a 248,000-token Qwen tokenizer and a MoE index with thousands of
  expert tensors are what push it into the megabytes. Start at 4 MB and double
  on a parse failure, or a rescan spends most of a second reading nothing.
- **A big model lives in its own folder, so the scan has to descend one level.**
  Five shards weighing 144 GB are not dropped beside a 2 GB file. A top-level-
  only scan reported "no models installed" with DeepSeek-V4-Flash plainly
  present in `models/v4flash/`. One level and no further: a models folder
  pointed at a drive root would otherwise read every directory on it.
- **A setting the app writes and nothing reads is worse than a missing one.**
  `models_dir` was saved to `settings.txt` by the window and consulted by no
  code anywhere, so it looked like it worked and silently did nothing. The
  reader belongs in `chaos_model::find`, beside the search order, where
  `chaos-run` and `chaos-serve` get it too.
- **`Vec::dedup` removes only *adjacent* duplicates.** The models search order
  named the download cache twice — once from the setting, once by default — and
  survived it only because the second pass skipped every label it had already
  seen. Deduplicating a path list wants a set.
- **A check tested only where it should say "no" may only ever say "no."** Two
  instances the same afternoon, 2026-08-31. `Tensor::is_contiguous` accumulated the
  expected stride one dimension late, so it answered `false` for **every** tensor
  with more than one row — and its three tests all asserted that a *view* is **not**
  contiguous, which a function returning a constant `false` passes. And
  `quality-gate.sh` kept the non-deterministic `generate ... tok/s` line in every
  recorded answer, so it **could not have passed a build against itself**; it had
  only been validated against 1 MiB of zeros, where a failure looks like a failure
  whichever way it is caused. **Assert the direction you believe, not only the one
  that fails**, and validate a gate by running it against an unchanged build.
- **ggml has no notion of "already computed."** `ggml_build_forward_expand` walks
  every ancestor of the root it is handed and evaluates all of them, so a value
  produced by an earlier `compute` in the same context is derived again by the
  next one. The only way to stop it is to hand the second graph a **leaf** —
  `ggml_new_tensor` with no op — holding that value. This cost V4-Flash 5.5 ms in
  each of 40 blocks, 11% of every token, because the router's own `compute` reaches
  back through `ffn_norm` into the whole block tail. `Context::compute_many` takes
  several roots at once and is how work is *moved* into that first evaluation
  rather than added to it.
- **Freezing a value is only safe where that value has actually been computed.**
  The same fix applied to V4-Flash's three hash layers would copy uninitialised
  arena: their `topk` is `get_rows(ffn_gate_tid2eid, tok)` and depends on the token
  ids alone, so the router's `compute` evaluates *nothing* of the tail there — which
  is exactly why those three blocks measure 0.000 s. The result would be fluent
  nonsense, not a crash. **Check what a compute's root actually depends on before
  assuming what it left behind**, and note that a sibling of an ancestor is not an
  ancestor: `gates.post` and `gates.comb` hang off `mixes` and are *not* reachable
  from `topk`.
- **A cache's hit rate and its benefit point in opposite directions past the peak.**
  V4-Flash's expert cache measured 14.2% hits at 1 GiB rising to 33.1% at 5 GiB,
  while tok/s went 0.649 -> 0.721 -> **0.505**: at 5 GiB it gets a third of its
  reads for free and is **1.19x slower than having no cache at all**, and 6 GiB is
  1.71x slower. Every cached byte is one the OS cannot use. **Tune a cache on the
  metric you care about, never on its hit rate** -- the hit rate will happily keep
  improving while the thing gets slower.
- **Size a long-lived allocation from *total* RAM, not free RAM.** Free RAM is read
  before the resident weights load and drifts with whatever else the machine is
  doing. The dense path's planner takes `available / 2`, which on this laptop asks
  for 4.9 GiB of expert cache -- a value measured at 0.505 tok/s against 0.603 with
  no cache. Total RAM minus the resident set minus a reserve lands on the peak.
- **`--auto` runs on the dense path only.** `auto_plan` takes a `Qwen3Config` and
  the deepseek4 dispatch returns from `main` before that config is built, so
  `--auto` makes **zero** decisions on DeepSeek-V4-Flash -- no threads, no prefill
  block, no I/O mode, no device -- while printing five of them for Qwen3-4B. A
  feature that is wired into one dispatch path and ticked as done is worse than a
  missing one, because the checkbox stops anyone looking.
- **A phase timer measures the phase, not the work you think is in it.** In
  `deepseek4_forward`'s block line, `ffn` covers graph construction plus the expert
  disk read and **not** the expert matmuls -- those are evaluated in the block's
  final `ctx.compute(&out)` along with everything else. Subtracting the read from
  the `ffn` phase to get "the expert arithmetic" yields 0.004 s, which is
  meaningless, and it was published for an hour on 2026-09-01. **Before attributing
  a phase timer's number to a subsystem, read what falls between the two
  `Instant`s.** The same mistake, in the same file, cost a day in August.
- **Q8_0 is not slow on x86, and "there is no x86 Q8_0 branch" does not mean it
  is.** At `[4096, 2048]` against one token: **F32 0.609 ms, BF16 0.296, Q8_0
  0.219** -- Q8_0 is the *fastest* of the three, at 0.36x F32's time on a quarter
  of the bytes. The missing x86 branch in `v4flash-repacking-2026-08-10` is the
  **repacked** fast path, not the base kernel. Any plan whose premise is "the trunk
  is slow because it is Q8_0" is dead on arrival.
- **These mat-vecs are memory-bound, so a bench that re-reads one weight flatters
  itself.** 40-57 GB/s "decoded" against `chaos-membench`'s 30.8 GiB/s peak means
  the weight is partly in cache across the repetitions. The engine reads each
  block's weights once per token and will do worse. Use such a bench for **ratios
  between dtypes**, never for an absolute rate.
