//! Resolving `v4flash` to five shard URLs needs a mapping from somewhere. A
//! remote index would mean running a service, versioning its schema, and
//! handling its outage — for data that changes a few times a year. A table in
//! the repository is reviewable in a diff, versioned with the code that reads
//! it, and works offline.
//!
//! # Models live on Hugging Face
//!
//! Not on GitHub. GitHub carries the code and the release binaries; the weights
//! are HF repositories, and for DeepSeek-V4-Flash specifically an Unsloth
//! dynamic quant split across five shards. A downloader written against the
//! GitHub API would be pointed at the wrong service entirely.
