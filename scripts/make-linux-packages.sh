Description: Run language models larger than your memory
 Chaos keeps the always-read weights resident and streams routed experts from
 disk per token, so a Mixture-of-Experts container far larger than RAM still
 generates text. A 155 GB model runs on a 16 GB machine.
 .
 Includes the runner, an OpenAI-compatible server, the downloader and the
 measurement tools.
