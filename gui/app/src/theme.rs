//! **Tokens, not literals.** Nothing outside this file names a colour. That is
//! the rule the previous window broke everywhere -- `BLACK` and `WHITE` were
//! spelled out at forty call sites, so the palette could not change without
//! forty edits, and the two that were missed are how a "two-value design" ended
//! up with a grey list box.
//!
//! The values come from Hermes' own `apps/desktop/DESIGN.md` and `styles.css`,
//! which Atur asked this app to follow: near-black `#17171A` rather than pure
//! black, a light ground by default, hairlines in four descending strengths,
//! and one accent used sparingly. The accent itself is Atur's `#0000F2` in
//! place of Hermes' `#0053FD`.
//!
//! This module is plain data and has no Win32 in it, so the palette and the
//! type scale are testable on any machine.
