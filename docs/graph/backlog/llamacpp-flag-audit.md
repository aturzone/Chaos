topic: Every one of llama.cpp's 182 flags, categorised against what Chaos has — the real denominator for "all of its options", replacing an estimate that was never checked
status: audited 2026-08-10, tracked
links: [lts-parity-criteria.md]
---

`lts-parity-criteria.md` said llama.cpp has "~100" CLI flags. That was a guess.
The real list, from `llama-completion --help` on build `daef2b3`:

```
$ llama-completion --help | grep -oE '\-\-[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]*' | sort -u | wc -l
182
```

## 2026-08-28 (§4b): recounted from both binaries — 165 / 17 / 0

**The split below is stale; the total is not.** Recomputed against the same
llama.cpp build (`daef2b3`, still 182 long flags):

```
llama-completion --help | grep -oE '\-\-[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]*' | sort -u   # 182
  intersected with chaos-run's REFUSED table (lines 1119-1217)                #  17 declined
  named anywhere else in chaos-run                                            # 165 implemented
  in neither                                                                  #   0
```

So **165 implemented, 17 declined, 0 unrecognised** — which is exactly what
`STATUS.md` says, and the `158 / 24` below is what drifted. Seven flags moved
from declined to implemented and the node was never updated.

**Two failed recounts before the right one, both of which disagreed with
STATUS.** The first took the REFUSED table as lines 1119-1200 when it ends at
1217, and reported 168/14. The second used a regex that only matched a flag on
the same line as its opening `(`, which silently dropped every multi-line tuple
and reported 165/0/17 — the same 17 flags, counted as *unrecognised* rather than
declined. **When a crude recount disagrees with a number whose source says it was
computed, suspect the recount.**

## 2026-08-14: 182 of 182 recognised — and one of them was being eaten

The count is now **computed from the two sources rather than tallied by hand**,
which is why it can be stated exactly:

```
$ llama-completion --help | grep -oE '\-\-[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]*' | sort -u   # 182
  intersected with chaos-run's match arms                                      # 158 implemented
  intersected with its REFUSED table                                            #  24 declined
  in neither                                                                    #   0
```

Every number this document carried before today was counted by reading, and one
of them was wrong in a way reading could not catch (see the `REFUSED` note at
the end — `--jinja` was in the table *and* implemented, and the table won).

**The zero is the part that was not free.** `--flash-attn`/`-fa` was in neither
set, and the consequence was not "the flag errors". The fallback arm took any
leftover token as the prompt, so:

```
$ chaos-run -m model.gguf -fa off "hello"
```

set `prompt = "-fa"`, discarded `"hello"`, exited **0**, and fluently completed
the wrong text. No message. This is the same failure the `REFUSED` table was
built to prevent, arriving through the gap the table does not cover: a table can
only decline flags someone thought of.

An unknown token starting with `-` is now an error, with `--` as the escape
hatch for a prompt that really does begin with a dash. `-fa on|auto` is accepted
— it describes what this build does, since `attention_flash` is the only
attention path — and `-fa off` is refused by name, because there is no `mul_mat`
path to switch to and **`-fa off` is one of the controls `parity-check.sh`
passes to the reference**. Silently ignoring it would have turned a parity check
into a comparison of a run with itself.

| bucket | flags | state |
|---|---:|---|
| **have** | **106** | done |
| **samplers** | 22 | **21 done**; only `--backend-sampling` left, and it is a GPU concept |
| interaction / prompt handling | 22 | **done 2026-08-11** — including a real REPL |

### The count in this document was wrong for eight commits

Every "have" figure before 2026-08-11 was measured by grepping **the help
text**, which lists a flag under one spelling and often the short one:
`--cache-type-k` prints as `-ctk`, `--typical-p` as `--typical`. The parser
accepted them; the count did not see them.

Measured from the parser instead:

```
$ grep -oE '"(-{1,2}[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]*)"' chaos-run.rs     | tr -d '"' | grep '^--' | sort -u | wc -l
106
```

**81 was an undercount of 25.** The lesson is the one this project keeps
relearning: measure the thing, not a description of the thing. A help text is a
description, and it drifts.

**"All of them" is not the right target and this table is why.** Fifteen are
GPU-only on an engine with no GPU backend; several more (`--no-mmap`,
`--mlock`, `--direct-io`) describe a loading strategy Chaos does not use
because it owns residency itself, which is the entire design. Implementing
those as no-ops that accept the flag and change nothing would be worse than not
having them — that is precisely the failure `-t` had for weeks.

The honest goal: **every flag that means something for a CPU runner that owns
its own residency**, which is roughly 120 of the 182.

## Done 2026-08-10 — samplers, 13 of them

`--typical`/`--typical-p`, `--top-nsigma`/`--top-n-sigma`, `--dynatemp-range`,
`--dynatemp-exp`, `--xtc-probability`, `--xtc-threshold`, `--mirostat`,
`--mirostat-ent`, `--mirostat-lr`, `--logit-bias`, `--ignore-eos`, on top of the
existing temperature/top-k/top-p/min-p/penalties.

**Three real bugs surfaced while wiring them**, all of the same shape — a flag
accepted, echoed, and silently doing nothing:

1. `is_greedy()` short-circuited to the raw argmax, so `--logit-bias` and
   `--ignore-eos` were ignored at temperature 0, which is Chaos's default.
2. `--mirostat 2` alone produced **byte-identical output to greedy**, twice:
   once through `is_greedy`, then again through the temperature-0 early return.
   llama.cpp's default temperature is 0.8 and ours is 0, so "mirostat with no
   other flags" is the normal way to ask for it and it did nothing.
3. Drawing XTC's random number unconditionally would have shifted the seeded
   stream for every existing `--seed` run that never asked for XTC.

Caught by tests and by running the flags against a real model and reading the
output. **Two of the three are invisible in any test that only checks the
process exits zero**, which is what makes this category worth the care.

## Done 2026-08-11 — interaction, and Chaos has a REPL

`-i`/`--interactive`, `-cnv`/`--conversation`, `-st`/`--single-turn`,
`--multiline-input`, `--in-prefix`, `--in-suffix`, `--in-prefix-bos`,
`-sys`/`--system-prompt`, `--system-prompt-file`, `-co`/`--color`,
`--simple-io`, `--display-prompt`/`--no-display-prompt`, `-sp`/`--special`,
`--print-token-count`, `--verbose-prompt`, `-e`/`--escape`/`--no-escape`,
`-r`/`--reverse-prompt`.

**The KV cache is what makes this worth having**: a turn costs only its new
tokens, because everything said so far is already in the cache. Verified as a
real conversation rather than a mechanism:

```
$ chaos-run <llama-3.2-1b> "Name the capital of France in one word." \
    -n 24 -cnv -sys "You are terse. Answer with one word only."
chat       llama3 template
Paris.
> What is the capital of Japan?
Tokyo.
```

Two things that would otherwise be silent:

- **`--escape` is on by default**, matching llama.cpp, so a prompt containing a
  backslash-n is two lines. Checked by token id rather than by eye: `198` (a
  real newline) with it, `1734` (a literal two-character sequence) with
  `--no-escape`.
- **Stop sequences reset per turn.** Carried over, a stop string from an earlier
  answer ends the next one instantly, and the session looks hung.

`--keep` is deliberately **not** accepted. It controls what survives a context
shift, and Chaos has no context shift — accepting it would be a flag that does
nothing, which is the exact failure this audit exists to prevent.

## Done 2026-08-11 — RoPE and YaRN, 9 of the 15

`--rope-freq-base`, `--rope-freq-scale`, `--rope-scale`, `--rope-scaling`,
`--yarn-ext-factor`, `--yarn-attn-factor`, `--yarn-beta-fast`,
`--yarn-beta-slow`, `--yarn-orig-ctx`.

These were nearly free and had been sitting there: `RopeParams` already carried
all six YaRN fields and `rope()` set exactly one of them, so ggml's `rope_ext`
was being handed defaults for the rest on every model. The container is now read
for `rope.scaling.factor`, `rope.scaling.type`, `attn_factor`, `beta_fast`,
`beta_slow` and `original_context_length`, and the flags override that.

**`--rope-scale` is the reciprocal of `--rope-freq-scale`** — llama.cpp's is a
multiplier on the *context*, ours on the *frequency*. Storing it unconverted
inverts every long-context model, silently.

Overrides are **printed**, not applied quietly:

```
$ chaos-run <llama-3.2-1b> ... --rope-freq-base 50000 --rope-scale 2
rope       overridden: freq_base 500000 -> 50000, freq_scale 1 -> 0.5
```

RoPE is the setting most likely to turn a working model into a fluent-but-wrong
one, and 500000 is Llama-3.2's real base — visible here only because the line is
printed.

**The other six are refused, not accepted:** `--grp-attn-n`/`-w` (self-extend,
not implemented), `--context-shift`/`--no-context-shift` and `--defrag-thold`
(no context shift and no KV fragmentation to threshold), `--swa-full` (we always
keep the full window cache, so the flag has nothing to switch).

## Done 2026-08-11 — logging, and the bug underneath it

`--log-disable`, `--log-file`, `--log-timestamps`/`--no-log-timestamps`,
`--log-prefix`/`--no-log-prefix`, `-v`/`--verbose`/`--log-verbose`,
`--verbosity`/`--log-verbosity`, `--perf`/`--no-perf`, `--version`.

**The flags are the smaller half. The real change is that status now goes to
stderr.** Everything the runner says about itself — shape, residency, prefill
timing — is diagnostics; the generated text is output. They shared stdout, so
`chaos-run … > answer.txt` captured a 16-line header along with the answer and
there was no way to separate them.

```
$ chaos-run <llama-3.2-1b> "The capital of France is" -n 6 --log-disable 2>/dev/null
 Paris. The capital of France

$ chaos-run … --log-file bt.log 2>/dev/null | head -3
 Paris. The capital of France
   [bt.log: 16 lines, starting "model      llama (direct (cache bypassed))"]

$ chaos-run … --log-timestamps --log-prefix
   0.152 I model      llama (direct (cache bypassed))
```

`--version` is handled **before the positional model path is taken**. Parsed
with the other flags it became the path, and the runner reported that it could
not open a file called `--version`.

Two of the thirteen are refused: `--log-colors` (status goes to a stream that
may be a file; llama.cpp's colour applies to a level marker we render as one
character) and `--no-host`, which is not a logging flag at all.

## Done 2026-08-11 — DRY, the sampler that actually breaks a loop

`--dry-multiplier`, `--dry-base`, `--dry-allowed-length`,
`--dry-penalty-last-n`, `--dry-sequence-breaker`.

DRY asks a narrower question than a repeat penalty. A repeat penalty punishes a
token for having appeared, which also suppresses the ordinary reuse prose is
made of. DRY looks for a *sequence* replaying and penalises only the token that
would continue it, growing the penalty geometrically with how long the run
already is.

```
$ chaos-run <llama-3.2-1b> "The sea is blue. The sea is blue. The sea is blue. The sea is" -n 14
 blue. The sea is blue. The sea is blue. The sea      <- stuck

$ ... --dry-multiplier 1.5
 ... blue. (Repeat ad infinitum)  This is a classic example
```

**Sequence breakers are what stop it penalising structure.** A match may not
cross a newline, quote, colon or asterisk, or a list is punished for having the
shape of a list. They arrive as text and the sampler works in token ids, so they
are resolved once the vocabulary exists; a breaker that is not a single token in
this vocabulary is **skipped rather than approximated**.

One test caught the author, not the code: a fixture written as
`[9,1,2,3,4,9,1,2,3]` has `9 1 2 3` repeating, so the match is four long and the
penalty is `base^2`, not `base^1`. The assertion was wrong and the
implementation was right — both cases are pinned now.

## Done 2026-08-11 — `--samplers` chain ordering; the sampler bucket is closed

`--samplers`, `--sampler-seq`, `--sampling-seq` (three spellings of one flag).

The chain was a fixed sequence of calls; it is now a `Vec<SamplerStage>` walked
in order. Same seed, same model, different order, different answer:

```
$ ... --temp 1.5 --top-p 0.5 --seed 9 --samplers "top_k;typ_p;top_p;min_p;xtc;temperature"
 vast and unpredictable, and its vastness is mirrored in t

$ ... --temp 1.5 --top-p 0.5 --seed 9 --samplers "temperature;top_p"
 turbulent, if we are successful it will determine us. Som
```

That is the whole point of the flag: a hot temperature flattens the
distribution, so `top_p 0.5` *after* it keeps a different set than before it.
Neither order is more correct and people ask for both.

**What is not reorderable, stated rather than papered over:** the penalties, DRY
and top-n-sigma act on **logits** and always run first; the six stages above act
on probabilities. That is also where llama.cpp puts them in its own default
chain, so the constraint costs nothing in practice.

**An unknown stage refuses the whole run** rather than dropping that stage:

```
$ ... --samplers "top_k;top_q"
chaos-run: --samplers: unknown stage "top_q"
  known stages: top_k, typ_p, top_p, min_p, xtc, temperature
  penalties, dry and top_n_sigma act on logits and always run first
$ echo $?
2
```

A typo that silently removed a filter would be the same class of failure as a
flag that does nothing — the user believes a constraint is active when it is
not.

`--backend-sampling` is the one sampler flag left and it is **won't**: it moves
sampling onto the GPU, and there is no GPU backend to move it to.

## Done 2026-08-11 - `--cache-type-k/v`, a quantised KV cache

`--cache-type-k`/`-ctk`, `--cache-type-v`/`-ctv`, taking `f16` (default) or
`q8_0`. This is the one flag in the list that changes what the engine *is* able
to do rather than how it is driven: the KV cache is the memory that grows with
context, and it is the axis this project competes on.

```
$ chaos-run <llama-3.2-1b> "The capital of France is" -n 10
kv cache   15 positions, 0.5 MiB, f16

$ chaos-run <llama-3.2-1b> "The capital of France is" -n 10 -ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0
kv cache   15 positions, 0.2 MiB, q8_0
```

**And the quality cost is measured, not asserted** - which is what the
perplexity work earlier today was for:

| KV storage | perplexity | bytes/value |
|---|---:|---:|
| f16 | 29.0909 | 2.00 |
| q8_0 | 28.9047 | 1.0625 |

**0.64% apart on 189 scored tokens.** q8_0 landing slightly *lower* is noise at
that sample size, not an improvement, and it must not be quoted as one.

Three things that would have been silent:

- **A block may not span two heads.** Quantisation runs row by row, where a row
  is `head_dim`; a block straddling a head boundary applies one head's scale to
  another head's values, which is fluent nonsense rather than an error.
- **`head_dim` must be a multiple of 32**, or a row does not hold whole blocks.
  Every architecture here uses 64, 128 or 256, but one that did not falls back
  to f16 **and says so** rather than being misquantised.
- **`is_consistent()` was counting values where the vectors now hold bytes.** It
  passed under f16 by coincidence and failed immediately under q8_0 - the test
  that caught it existed already and was checking the right thing.

K and V share one type because ggml's banded attention asserts
`k->type == v->type`; accepting different ones would work until that path was
reached. Both spellings are accepted and the last wins.

`q4_0` is **not** offered. ggml has the kernels, but the accuracy cost at 4 bits
in attention is real and unmeasured here, and offering a type without the
perplexity number beside it is the thing this audit exists to prevent.

## Done 2026-08-11 - I/O mode, metadata override, and a long refusal list

`--direct-io`, `--no-direct-io`/`--no-mmap`, `--override-kv`, `--usage`.

**`--no-mmap` lands on the same switch as `--no-direct-io`**, because what it
means -- "do not let the OS page cache hold the weights" -- is what direct I/O
already does here. Both are real modes in `chaos-io`, so this is a genuine
switch rather than an accepted no-op:

```
$ chaos-run <model> ...
model      llama (direct (cache bypassed))
$ chaos-run <model> ... --no-direct-io
model      llama (buffered (page cache in use))
```

**`--override-kv key=type:value`** is the escape hatch for a container whose
metadata is wrong. GGUFs are often converted by third parties, and a mislabelled
`rope.freq_base` makes a model answer fluently and wrongly with nothing to point
at. Overriding beats editing a multi-gigabyte file, and the run says which
override it used. Proven load-bearing rather than merely printed:

```
$ chaos-run <llama-3.2-1b> -f prose.txt -n 10
 similar with the invention of the printing press. Befor

$ ... --override-kv llama.rope.freq_base=float:1000
 esta, and siesta is a thing, and
```

A malformed spec **refuses the run** (exit 2) rather than being skipped: an
override silently dropped is worse than none, because the user believes the
container has been corrected.

### Long-form aliases and `-m`/`-p` - done 2026-08-11

`-m`/`--model`, `-p`/`--prompt`, `--file`, `--batch-size`, `--n-predict`,
`--predict`, `--repack`, `--help`, `-if`/`--interactive-first`.

Muscle memory is the stated reason for copying a CLI, and until now the model
and prompt could **only** be positional: someone typing
`chaos-run -m model.gguf -p "hi"` got a file-not-found for `-m`. The first
argument is now treated as the path only when it is not a flag.

`--interactive-first` is not an alias for `-i` and is implemented as its own
thing: the user speaks before the model does.

```
$ printf 'What is 2 plus 2?
' | chaos-run -m <llama-3.2-1b>     -p "You are a calculator." -n 10 -if -cnv
> The answer is... 4!
```

The option list is now one `usage()` function rather than a block inside
`main`, so `--help`, `-h` and a bare invocation cannot drift apart.

### Prompt cache - done 2026-08-11, and worth 19x on a repeated prompt

`--prompt-cache FILE`, `--prompt-cache-all`, `--prompt-cache-ro`.

Prefill is the expensive half for anything with a long prompt, and re-running
the same prefix every invocation is the largest avoidable cost in an agent loop.

```
run 1  prompt cache  wrote 15.1 MiB for 482 tokens
       prefill    482 tokens in 1.5s (318.59 tok/s)

run 2  prompt cache  reused 481 of 482 tokens
       prefill    482 tokens in 0.1s (6116.11 tok/s)
```

**Reuse stops at the first differing token.** Past it every stored key is
conditioned on text that is no longer there, and attention would read it
without complaint. So the cache is truncated to the common prefix rather than
accepted or rejected whole -- which is what makes it useful for a prompt that
was *edited* rather than repeated exactly:

```
$ chaos-run <same model> -f edited.txt --prompt-cache pc.bin
prompt cache  reused 115 of 121 tokens
```

The last prompt token is never restored: the forward pass has to run for at
least one position to produce the logits generation starts from.

**A fingerprint guards it.** Restoring keys computed by a different model, or
under a different KV quantisation, is not an error anywhere downstream --
attention reads numbers that mean nothing and the answer is fluent and wrong. So
the file records the shape it was built with (layers, embedding, heads, kv
heads, head_dim, vocab, KV type) and a mismatch discards it. Verified: the same
cache offered to TinyLlama restores **nothing**.

Correctness checked the only way that counts -- a reused cache must produce the
**same text** as a cold run, and does.

Failure never fails the run: an unreadable or unwritable cache is a lost
optimisation, and is reported rather than raised.

### `--chat-template` - done 2026-08-11

Forces one of the nine known formats, overriding what the container declares.
Two cases make it necessary rather than a curiosity: a container with **no**
template (common in base-model conversions) and one whose template this build
does not recognise. Both otherwise fall back to a plain framing the model was
never trained on, and the model answers fluently and wrongly.

Proven by the token stream rather than the header, on TinyLlama:

```
zephyr (detected)  23 tokens: [1, 529, 29989, 1792, 29989, 29958, ...]   <|user|>
chatml (forced)    33 tokens: [1, 529, 29989, 326, 29918, 2962, ...]     <|im_start|>
```

An unknown name **refuses the run** and lists the nine, rather than falling back
to generic framing.

Applied on **both** engine paths. The dense path and V4-Flash build their
tokenizers separately, and a flag honoured on only one of them is exactly the
failure `-t` had for weeks — so it is one helper called twice, not two copies.

~~**`--chat-template-file` and `--jinja` are refused.**~~ **Retracted — both are
implemented.** The original reasoning was that they supply a Jinja template to be
*evaluated*, while this build matched template text against nine patterns and
rendered with its own code, so accepting a file would honour some and silently
ignore others.

The objection was right and the conclusion was wrong: silently ignoring some was
never the only alternative to declining all. `crates/chaos-jinja` evaluates the
container's own template and **refuses, loudly and by name, any construct outside
the subset it implements** — so a template it cannot handle produces an error,
not a quiet fallback to the wrong framing. That is the property the refusal was
protecting, obtained without the refusal.

This paragraph outlived the code by three commits and was still being cited. The
`REFUSED` row for `--jinja` outlived it too; see the table at the end.

### `--mlock` - done 2026-08-11, and it is not one call

Chaos's whole design is deciding what stays in RAM. That decision is undone if
the OS pages the resident set out, and this project has **measured** the
consequence: past ~6 GiB the expert cache reached a 71% hit rate while being the
slowest configuration tested, because the hits were page faults in disguise.

On Windows `VirtualLock` alone is not enough. A process may only lock up to its
working-set maximum, which defaults to a few megabytes, so locking a gigabyte
fails with `ERROR_WORKING_SET_QUOTA` (1453) unless `SetProcessWorkingSetSize`
raised the ceiling first. **A `--mlock` that called only `VirtualLock` would
look implemented, return an error nobody checks, and lock nothing** — which is
why this was deferred a tick rather than shipped quickly.

```
$ chaos-run <llama-3.2-1b> ... --mlock
mlock      0.31 GiB pinned in physical memory; 0.44 GiB of repacked weights
           are in ggml arena and not covered
resident   146 tensors, 0.74 GiB
```

**The line says what is not covered**, because 0.31 against a resident 0.74
otherwise reads as a bug. Repacked tensors live inside ggml own arena and this
code has no address for them. A partial lock stated plainly beats a total that
quietly means something else.

Failure is counted, not fatal: a partially locked residency still helps, and the
run says how much did not take and why.

## Done 2026-08-11 - six flags, and a completion list that could not be trusted

| flag | what it does, provably |
|---|---|
| `--binary-file F` | prompt from raw bytes, decoded lossily. **Not a duplicate of `-f`**: `read_to_string` *fails* on non-UTF-8, so a prompt captured from a binary source is unreachable through `-f`. Verified by running both on the same file — `-f` errors, `--binary-file` runs |
| `--chat-template-file F` | the template from a file, because a real Jinja template is several hundred characters no shell survives. An unrecognised name is still **refused with the known list**, not ignored |
| `--log-colors` / `--no-log-colors` | dims status so the generated text is findable when both share a terminal. **Never applied to `--log-file`** — escape codes in a file break every reader that is not a terminal |
| `--prio N` / `--prio-batch N` | real process priority (`SetPriorityClass` / `setpriority`). Applied before the model opens, so the load benefits. **`3` maps to HIGH, not REALTIME, and says so** — realtime outranks the kernel's input and disk threads and can freeze the desktop with no way to click anything |
| `--warmup` / `--no-warmup` | one throwaway forward pass on a discarded cache: page cache, repacked copies, arenas, and one timed token for the thread ladder. **Off by default, unlike llama.cpp** — warming a disk-streaming runner reads gigabytes, and the cold cost is the number this project exists to report honestly |
| `--completion-bash` | a bash completion script |

### The completion list drifted within the hour, in both directions

The first version was hand-written from the help text. Checked against the
parser it claimed **four flags that do not exist** (`--keep`, `--tfs`,
`--no-cnv`, `--no-penalize-nl`) and was **missing 23 that do**. A phantom flag
is worse than a missing one: the shell suggests it and the binary then rejects
it.

That is the same failure as the flag count this document carried for eight
commits — **anything that enumerates the flags is a second copy of the parser
and will drift.** So `build.rs` now scans `chaos-run.rs` for the string
literals its `match` arms are made of and emits the list. Currently **119 long
flags**, and the check that found the drift now reports 0 phantom and 0
missing.

### Refused, with reasons - most of the runtime bucket

These are declined rather than accepted-and-ignored. That is the whole point of
this audit, and the standard `-t` failed for weeks.

**This table is now checked by a test, because it had stopped being true.**
`REFUSED` is consulted from the fallback arm of the argument match, so any flag
that later gains an explicit arm *shadows* its own row and the row goes
unreachable while still reading as a statement about the binary. `--jinja` sat
in exactly that state — the row said "no Jinja engine" while `chaos-jinja`
evaluated templates one arm above it. Nothing failed; the table simply lied, and
this document, generated from it, lied too.

`declined_flags_actually_decline` extracts the table from `chaos-run.rs` at test
time and runs the binary once per row. **The exit code alone does not
discriminate** — a shadowed flag parses fine and then dies on the missing model,
exiting 2 exactly as a refusal does. The message is the evidence, so the test
requires `is not supported` and not merely a status.

| flag | why |
|---|---|
| `--parallel` | one sequence at a time by design: one weight set, one KV cache |
| `--poll`, `--poll-batch` | ggml owns its threadpool; there is no spin/yield knob to forward a value to |
| `--defrag-thold` | the KV cache is append-only and never fragments |
| ~~`--warmup`/`--no-warmup`~~ | **retracted and implemented.** "Nothing is warmed" was wrong: the page cache, the repacked tensors, the arenas and the thread ladder all are. The default stays off, which is the honest part |
| ~~`--check-tensors`~~ | **retracted and implemented.** "Would have to dequantise every tensor" was wrong: the f16 block scales are checkable without dequantising anything, and a bad scale is exactly where a ruined quantise shows up. See the 2026-08-11 entry above |
| ~~`--cpu-mask`, `--cpu-range`, `--cpu-strict`~~ | **retracted and implemented.** "No thread-affinity layer" described the code, not the difficulty: it is `SetThreadAffinityMask` and `sched_setaffinity`, one syscall each. `--poll` stayed behind because it is genuinely about ggml's threadpool internals |
| ~~`--ubatch-size`~~ | **retracted and implemented.** "`-b` is the only batch dimension here" was true and still is — so `-ub` takes the *smaller* of the two and says which it took, which is what the flag means on one dimension |
| ~~`--fit`, `--fit-ctx`, `--fit-target`~~ | **retracted and implemented.** "`chaos-model-info --budget` answers this already" was an argument for a different spelling, not against the flag. A user with a llama.cpp command line cannot reach a second binary |
| ~~`--numa`~~ | **partly implemented.** `--numa isolate` binds to one node's CPUs and is real. `distribute` and `numactl` place *individual threads* on chosen nodes, which needs the threadpool ggml owns — those two are refused by name, in their own message |
| ~~`--jinja`, `--chat-template-file`~~ | **retracted and implemented.** The argument was "a half-implemented Jinja silently produces the wrong framing" — correct, and answered by building an engine that **refuses what it cannot evaluate** rather than guessing. See the Jinja section above |

## Next batches, in order
2. **RoPE / context (15)** — `--rope-freq-base`, `--rope-freq-scale`,
   `--rope-scaling`, YaRN. Cheap, and needed for any model whose container
   disagrees with its training context.
4. **Logging (13)** — `--log-file`, `--log-disable`, `--verbose`, timestamps.
   Cheap and mechanical.
5. **KV cache types (2)** — `--cache-type-k/v`. Real work and real value: it
   halves KV memory, which is the axis this project competes on.
6. **Grammar / JSON schema (4)** — previously marked `won't for LTS`. Reopened
   because an agent calling a local model wants constrained output more than it
   wants most of the above.
