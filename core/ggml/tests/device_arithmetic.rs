//! Does the device compute the same numbers the CPU does?
//!
//! This is the milestone the GPU tier actually turns on. Enumerating a card
//! proves the registry works; allocating on it proves the buffer type works;
//! only *matching the CPU element for element* proves the binding is right.
//!
//! The project's standing lesson applies with full force here: a wrong forward
//! pass produces fluent nonsense, never a crash. A device path that uploads to
//! the wrong offset, or reads back a stale buffer, returns numbers — plausible
//! ones — and the first symptom is a model that answers slightly wrongly. So
//! the acceptance test is an exact comparison against the path we already trust.
//!
//! Skips itself when there is no GPU, which is every CI runner — and compiles
//! away entirely without ggml, since `Backend` and `Context` do not exist
//! there. `real_weights.rs` needs no such gate because it imports only the
//! always-present entry points; this one is built on the ggml-only types.
