## Start here

**1. Install.**

Every platform gets a file from
[Releases](https://github.com/aturzone/Chaos/releases). Pick the one for yours.

| you have | download | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Windows** | `Chaos-vX.Y.Z-windows-x86_64-Setup.exe` | double-click; per-user, no admin rights |
| **Debian / Ubuntu** | `chaos_X.Y.Z_amd64.deb` | `sudo apt install ./chaos_*.deb` |
| **any Linux** | `Chaos-vX.Y.Z-linux-x86_64.AppImage` | one file, `chmod +x` and run |
| **macOS (Apple silicon)** | `Chaos-vX.Y.Z-macos-arm64.tar.gz` | unpack, then the copy below |
| **Windows / Linux, no installer** | the `.zip` / `.tar.gz` | unpack it yourself |

The Windows installer carries every binary inside it: no archive to unpack, no
PowerShell, no administrator rights. It puts Chaos on your PATH and adds a Start
Menu entry, and it says whether it is installing or updating before you press the
button.

From an archive, copy the binaries yourself:

```bash
sudo install -m 755 Chaos-*/chaos-* /usr/local/bin/ && mkdir -p ~/.chaos/models
```

**The window is Windows-only.** `chaos-app` is written against Win32, so the
Linux and macOS builds are the command-line tools -- `chaos-run`, `chaos-serve`,
`chaos-probe`, `chaos-pull`, `chaos-draw` and the rest. `chaos-serve` speaks the OpenAI API, so
any client works on every platform.

**2. Get a model.** Ask Chaos for one:

```bash
chaos-pull --list          # 13 models, with the size that actually matters
chaos-pull qwen3-4b        # ~2.5 GB, a good first one
```

...or drop any `.gguf` into `~/.chaos/models` (`%USERPROFILE%\.chaos\models` on
Windows). Nothing is downloaded unless you ask for it.

**3. Run it.**

```bash
chaos-run                                   # lists the models you have
chaos-run qwen3 "The capital of France is"  # any unique part of a name works
```

That is the whole thing. You never type a path, and for a model split across
five shards you never work out which shard to open.

```bash
chaos-run qwen3 "write a haiku" -n 64 --auto   # --auto reads your machine and configures itself
chaos-probe                                    # what can this machine run, and what should you close?
chaos-serve qwen3 --port 8080                  # then open http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

**Or use the window.** `chaos-app` on Windows is a native application: pick a
model, load it, chat, download more. Two colours, no dependencies, a real Win32
window rather than a browser in a frame.

```
INSTALLED  AVAILABLE      v4flash UD-Q4_K_XL  155 GB [5 files]  needs 7.92 GB - streams
                          qwen3-32b Q4_K_M    19.8 GB           needs 19.8 GB - too big
```

**Read the second column, not the first.** A 155 GB model streams on a 16 GB
machine; a 20 GB dense one does not, because a dense container has no routed
experts to leave on disk.

**And it draws.** `chaos-draw` runs a diffusion pipeline the same way — four
files, 16.7 GB, none of which has to fit in memory at once.

```bash
chaos-pull ideogram-4 ideogram-4-uncond qwen3-vl-8b flux2-vae
chaos-draw "a red apple on a white table" --grid 64 --steps 20 -o apple.png
```

Qwen3-VL-8B turns the prompt into conditioning, two copies of Ideogram 4 — the
conditional model and a separately trained unconditional twin — denoise a latent,
and the FLUX.2 autoencoder turns it into pixels.

> **Colour and scene follow the prompt; object form is still imperfect.** Said
> here because a diffusion pipeline that is subtly wrong produces a *plausible*
> picture, so "it drew something" is not evidence. What is measured: the
> autoencoder round-trips real photographs at **36.09–40.89 dB** (with the check
> ablated three ways first — each deliberate bug still produced a recognisable
> image), the text encoder answers `" Paris"` at logit 22.58, and the denoiser
> scores **0.85 velocity cosine** against a real latent. Structured, JSON-shaped
> prompts condition about three times as strongly as a bare phrase.

**`chaos-serve` gives you a window as well as a socket.** Open its address in a
browser and you get a chat interface; point a coding agent at
`/v1/chat/completions` and it gets the OpenAI API. Same process, same model
loaded once. The page is compiled into the binary — no CDN, no fonts, no
install, and it works with the network cable out.

<details>
<summary>Two things about your first run, both deliberate</summary>

- **It will be slow once, if it uses the GPU.** ggml compiles its Vulkan shaders
  on first use and the driver caches them afterwards. Measured: 1.63 tok/s on the
  first `--auto` run, **9.0–9.6 tok/s on every run after**. Nothing is wrong.
- **A model whose architecture has never been diffed against llama.cpp is
  refused by name.** That includes `qwen3moe`, so Qwen3-30B-A3B needs `--force`.
  A wrong forward pass produces fluent nonsense rather than an error, so the
  default is refusal.
</details>

## What it actually does

Chaos runs a **144 GB** Mixture-of-Experts model on a **15.7 GiB** laptop and
produces correct text, by never loading the model. The weights every token needs
stay in RAM; the routed experts — most of the container, of which a token uses
six of 256 — are read from disk as routing selects them.

```console
$ chaos-run deepseek "The capital of France is" -n 8
model      deepseek4 (direct (cache bypassed))
shape      43 blocks, 4096 embd, 64 heads, 256 experts (6 used, 1 shared)
resident   loaded 534 tensors, 7.24 GiB of 7.24 GiB budget in 4.9s (1.58 GB/s)
           0.14 GiB did not fit and will be re-read from disk on EVERY token (~0.1s each)
           closing these would free up to 1.19 GiB:
             claude.exe                   1.19 GiB (12 processes)
           that is enough to make the whole model resident.
prefill    5 tokens in 8.0s (0.63 tok/s)
output      Paris.
generate   7 tokens in 16.4s (0.428 tok/s, 2.3s per token)
```

That resident block is the point. It is not a progress bar: it is the size of
your shortfall, what it costs per token, and which processes would fix it.

## How fast, honestly

**Every row was measured with both engines alternating in one session**, because
this machine drifts by up to 25% with its own state. Command lines and raw output
for each:
[`where-we-stand-vs-llamacpp-2026-08-16.md`](docs/graph/research/where-we-stand-vs-llamacpp-2026-08-16.md).

| | Chaos | llama.cpp | |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| DeepSeek-V4-Flash (144 GB), prefill ms/token | **1640** | 1679 | parity |
| DeepSeek-V4-Flash, generation | **0.394** | 0.39 | parity |
| Qwen3-30B-A3B, generation | 3.03–3.86 | 3.35 | parity |
| Qwen3-4B, generation, both at defaults | **8.01** | 6.52 | 1.23x ahead |
| Qwen3-4B, generation, both hand-tuned | 7.64 | **9.16** | 1.20x behind |

**Out of the box we lead because we measure your machine and llama.cpp uses a
fixed default. Given equal care on both sides llama.cpp is faster on dense
models.** On models that stream from disk, the two are level.

If you want the fastest local inference today, use
[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp). Chaos is worth your time if
you want an engine that owns residency and tells you the truth about your
machine.

<details>
<summary>Three claims that are retracted and must not be repeated</summary>

- ~~"Chaos runs models larger than RAM and llama.cpp cannot."~~ It can, with
  `--no-repack`. Larger-than-RAM is not the differentiator.
- ~~"Generation is ~2x behind on Qwen3-30B."~~ Re-measured alternating: parity.
- ~~"On V4-Flash: prefill 1.62x behind, generation 3-4x behind."~~ That stood in
  this README for nine days. Re-measured: parity on both. It is a correction in
  our favour, which is not better — and the discarded warm-up in that session
  read llama.cpp at 0.23 tok/s, which would have made it a 1.7x *lead*. It is
  not one.
</details>

## Progress

Every bar is a ratio of two counted things, both named. Filled cells are floored,
never rounded up.

```
CLI flags         91%  [##################..]  165 of llama.cpp's 182
Chat templates    96%  [###################.]  52 of its 54 names
Tokenizers        83%  [################....]  5 of 6 families
Samplers          80%  [################....]  16 of 20
Architectures      9%  [#...................]  13 of the 141 it declares
GPU backends      20%  [####................]  1 of 5, Vulkan only
Browser UI        33%  [######..............]  2 of 6 things a chat UI needs
V4-Flash speed     2%  [....................]  0.394 of 20 tok/s
```

Where those numbers come from, in the same order: 17 flags are declined with a
written reason and **0 are unrecognised**; the two missing templates are Hunyuan
variants; the tokenizer families are BPE, SPM, WordPiece, Unigram and RWKV; the
sampler audit was 2026-08-11; **every one of the 13 architectures was diffed
against llama.cpp at 8 prompts**, which is what counts as verified here; the
Vulkan device path is bound but **not** verified — it fails 1 of those 8 prompts
where the CPU path fails none; and the UI **sends and streams**, with no model
picker, stop button, saved history or sampler controls.

The first four are enforced by tests rather than counted by hand
(`refused_flags_decline`, `jinja_agrees_with_families`), which is why they have
stopped drifting.

The last bar is the honest one. **`V4-Flash speed` will not move, and we
measured how far it cannot move.** A token is 1.56 s of expert reading plus
**0.84 s that never touches the disk** — so with the entire 144 GB model resident
in RAM, this CPU tops out at **1.19 tok/s**. 20 tok/s is a 50 ms token: the fixed
cost alone is 17x over budget, and it separately needs 67.7 GB/s of bandwidth to
the expert weights. That is a GPU-memory specification, not a code change.

So here is the thing nobody had published — **tok/s against resident RAM for a
144 GB model**, which Chaos can sweep because it owns residency where an `mmap`
engine cannot be told to use exactly N GiB:

```
    RAM     experts resident    tok/s
   16 GB           ~3%          0.42   <- measured on the laptop above
   64 GB          ~38%          0.55
  128 GB          ~85%          0.93
  160 GB          100%          1.19   <- the ceiling, nothing left to stream
```

**Holding the whole model in RAM is worth 2.9x, not 48x.** That is a useful
answer even though it is not the hoped-for one, and it is the kind of thing this
project exists to tell you before you spend money.
[`v4flash-ram-frontier-2026-08-16.md`](docs/graph/research/v4flash-ram-frontier-2026-08-16.md)
has the sweep, the fit (R² = 0.997) and the controls.

## How the repository is laid out

Grouped by what a crate is *for*, which is the shape the Rust book's workspace
chapter shows:

```
Chaos/
├── Cargo.toml
├── core/      the engine: containers, ggml, IO, residency, architectures, images
├── cli/       chaos-run -- a model, a prompt, a terminal
├── network/   chaos-serve -- the OpenAI API and a browser page
└── gui/       the Windows window, and the installer that carries every binary
```

Everything used to sit in one flat `crates/`, which said nothing about which of
fourteen crates to read first. **The crate names did not change with the
directories** — `core/gguf` is still the `chaos-gguf` package — so `cargo build
-p chaos-gguf`, every binary name, and every `use chaos_gguf::` mean exactly
what they did before.

`core/` bottom to top: `build` (build-script helpers) · `gguf` (containers) ·
`ggml` (the FFI) · `io` (cache-bypassing reads) · `probe` (hardware) · `plan`
(prediction, residency) · `model` (sharding, the catalogue, releases) ·
`tokenizer` · `grammar` · `jinja` · `arch` (the forward pass) · `image`
(diffusion, PNG, safetensors).

## Build from source

```bash
# ggml once -- Chaos borrows its kernels rather than rewriting years of SIMD work
git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp
cmake -S llama.cpp -B llama.cpp/build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF
cmake --build llama.cpp/build --config Release -j

git clone https://github.com/aturzone/Chaos && cd Chaos
export GGML_LIB_DIR=$PWD/../llama.cpp/build/ggml/src
cargo build --release
```

Clean clone to working binaries: **23 s**. Nine of the ten crates build without
`GGML_LIB_DIR` at all, and CI proves it.

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows</strong> — GNU toolchain, not MSVC</summary>

```powershell
rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
# install MSYS2, then put C:\msys64\mingw64\bin on PATH (for libgomp)
$env:GGML_LIB_DIR = "C:/path/to/llama.cpp/build/ggml/src"
cargo build --release
```

`cannot find -lgomp` means MSYS2's `mingw64/bin` is not on PATH. Git Bash has its
own `/mingw64` which is **not** MSYS2's and has no `gcc` — check `which gcc`.

**MSYS2 is needed to build, not to run**: the GNU C++ and OpenMP runtimes link
statically, so the `.exe` runs on a machine that has never seen it. Linked
dynamically it died with `0xC0000135` before `main`, printing nothing.

`.cargo/config.toml` sets `link-self-contained=no` and must stay — MSYS2 gcc
16.1.0 dropped symbols rustup's bundled `crt2.o` still references.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>GPU</strong> — a second ggml build</summary>

The CPU build has no Vulkan archive, and the GPU tests **skip** rather than fail
without a card, so a green run proves nothing about the device path. Build ggml
again with `-DGGML_VULKAN=ON` into its own directory and point `GGML_LIB_DIR`
there for any work touching `--device`, `-ngl` or `-ot`.
</details>
