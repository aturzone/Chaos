//! Chaos, as a window.
//!
//! A real Win32 application: `RegisterClassW`, a message loop, a menu bar,
//! native controls, GDI painting. No browser, no webview, no HTML, and no GUI
//! dependency -- the whole surface it uses is declared in `win32.rs` against
//! libraries Windows already ships.
//!
//! **Four pages, one of which owns the screen at a time.** The first version of
//! this window grew a control at a time into a single 380px column, and Atur's
//! verdict was exact: *"why is all click in one slot"*. `nav.rs` is the answer
//! written down as data -- where every control lives -- and `theme.rs` is the
//! palette, so nothing in this file names a colour. Both are testable without a
//! window server, which is most of what this file used to get wrong.
//!
//! The design follows Hermes' own `apps/desktop/DESIGN.md`, which Atur asked
//! this to match: flat rather than boxed, one primitive per concern, tokens
//! rather than literals, durable destinations, and expensive surfaces staying
//! mounted while hidden.
//!
//! The engine runs as a child `chaos-serve` process; `client.rs` says why at
//! length. The short version is that unloading a model has to actually free
//! 7 GiB, and that a second in-process construction path is where this codebase
//! has historically hidden its worst bug.
