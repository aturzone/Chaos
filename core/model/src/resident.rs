//! Load the always-read weights into RAM and keep them there.
//!
//! This is the step that decides whether a model is usable on a small machine.
//! The always-read weights — attention, routers, shared experts, embeddings —
//! are touched on *every* token. Resident, they cost one read for the whole
//! session. Not resident, they are re-read from disk on every token forever.
//!
//! # The budget is a hard ceiling, not a target
//!
//! Loading past what RAM can hold does not degrade gracefully; it makes the OS
//! swap, and swapping is **slower than the streaming it was meant to replace**.
//! So the loader refuses. A model that will not fit is reported as not fitting,
//! with the number, rather than started and left to thrash.
//!
//! # Why it loads into our own memory rather than mapping the file
//!
//! Owning the allocation is the point: it cannot be evicted behind our back,
//! it does not double-count against the page cache, and its cost is exactly
//! what we accounted for. A mapped file offers none of those guarantees
//! precisely when memory is tight — which is always, here.
