//! Does a graph with operands in two different buffers compute the right answer?
//!
//! This is the test the GPU tier stalled on. `mixed-residency-segfaults` records
//! three access violations in one session from exactly this shape — one host
//! tensor, one device tensor, one graph — and the response at the time was to
//! forbid it and ship a device-only slice. Five declined flags (`--split-mode`,
//! `--tensor-split`, `--op-offload`, `-ngl`, `--n-gpu-layers`) are all downstream
//! of that refusal.
//!
//! Two things have to be true and only one of them is the answer:
//!
//! 1. the numbers match a reference computed by hand, and
//! 2. **the scheduler actually split the graph.** A partition of one is a
//!    scheduler that found everything on one backend, which would pass check (1)
//!    while proving nothing. `splits()` is asserted for that reason.
//!
//! The CPU-only cases run everywhere, including CI, and they are not filler:
//! `HostBuffer` — the buffer identity that makes a zero-copy host tensor legal
//! to copy *from* — is where the segfault actually lived, and it is testable
//! without a card.
