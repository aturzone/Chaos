> ## SUPERSEDED — retired 2026-08-31, kept for the reasoning only
>
> **This epic describes a product that no longer exists.** It was written when
> Chaos was to be a Python wrapper driving someone else's engine — SGLang or
> ktransformers — on Linux with an NVIDIA card. `decisions/stack.md` was accepted
> on 2026-08-03 and settled the opposite: *"Chaos is *the runner*, not a front-end
> that shells out to someone else's."* What shipped is a Rust workspace with
> **zero third-party dependencies**, running on Windows against Vulkan.
>
> It stayed `status: open` for four weeks after that decision, and an audit on
> 2026-08-31 found that these five files together carried **26 tickets counted as
> outstanding work**. Any percentage-complete figure that included them was wrong
> by about twenty points, in the direction that makes a project look worse than it
> is — which is its own kind of dishonesty.
>
> **Do not schedule anything here.** Some of the *questions* are still good; where
> one is, it has been re-asked in a live node. This file is history.
## Tickets
- [ ] T1: Build the CLI skeleton (subcommands: probe, recommend, launch, bench) with arg parsing and a config file schema every subcommand reads from — depends: ../research/mvp-scope.md — evidence: ../research/mvp-scope.md (New work — CLI skeleton, no ticket in any epic builds "the wrapper" as a runnable program) — acceptance: `--help` enumerates all four v1 subcommands, and a malformed config file produces a named parse error instead of an unhandled exception.
- [ ] T2: Implement upstream version detection for ktransformers/kt-kernel/SGLang via stable surfaces (`pip show` / import-and-check) per the ADR's version-tracking amendment, never vendoring or pinning a commit — depends: ../decisions/fork-vs-wrapper.md — evidence: ../research/mvp-scope.md (New work — version detection) — acceptance: on a machine with all three packages installed the detector prints their exact installed version strings, and on a machine missing one it names the missing package instead of failing silently.
- [ ] T3: Build launch-flag generation/pass-through that turns gap-closure T2 (#2)'s split recommendation plus hardware-profiler T1/T2/T4 (#8/#9/#11) probe outputs into `--kt-expert-placement-strategy` / `--kt-num-gpu-experts` / `--kt-gpu-experts-ratio` flags and invokes `python -m sglang.launch_server`, scoped to DeepSeek-class MoE on Linux+NVIDIA only — depends: ../history/gap-closure.md, ../history/hardware-profiler.md — evidence: ../research/mvp-scope.md (New work — launch-flag assembly; T2's acceptance stops at "returns a recommendation," not "launches anything") — acceptance: given a fixed split recommendation and probe output, the generated flag string is byte-identical across three consecutive runs and successfully starts `sglang.launch_server` on a Linux+NVIDIA target.
- [ ] T4: Wire the CLI (T1), version detection (T2), gap-closure T2 (#2), hardware-profiler T1/T2/T4 (#8/#9/#11), launch-flag assembly (T3), and benchmark-harness T1/T2 (#15/#16) into one end-to-end orchestration command: probe -> recommend -> flags -> launch -> report tok/s — depends: ../history/benchmark-harness.md — evidence: ../research/mvp-scope.md (New work — end-to-end one-command UX) — acceptance: running the single orchestration command on the target model/platform prints one real tok/s figure with no manual step between stages.
- [ ] T5: Package the CLI as an installable pip entry point and write the README quickstart that walks a user from `pip install` to a printed tok/s number — depends: ../research/mvp-scope.md — evidence: ../research/mvp-scope.md ("Launch" = README quickstart definition) — acceptance: from a clean virtualenv, `pip install` followed only by the README's documented commands prints a tok/s number with no undocumented setup step required.
