//! Splitting text before BPE runs, chosen by `tokenizer.ggml.pre`.
//!
//! BPE never merges across a split boundary, so this decides which merges are
//! even *possible*. Get it wrong and the ids differ from what the model was
//! trained on; the model then predicts a fluent continuation of the wrong tokens,
//! which looks like a broken forward pass rather than a broken splitter.
//!
//! # The variants are not interchangeable, and the container says which
//!
//! Measured with `llama-tokenize` on the models in this repository:
//!
//! ```text
//!              "4567"            "12345678"             "don't"
//! qwen2        4 5 6 7           1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8        don 't
//! llama-bpe    456 7             123 456 78             don 't
//! ```
//!
//! One digit at a time against groups of three. Every number in a prompt
//! tokenizes differently, and every boundary after it shifts. `tokenizer.ggml.pre`
//! was previously **ignored**, so a Qwen container was split with Llama's rule
//! and a contraction was cut into three pieces (`don`, `'`, `t`) where both
//! reference implementations produce two.
//!
//! # Why this is hand-written
//!
//! The patterns need negative lookahead (`\s+(?!\S)`) and case-insensitive
//! alternation, and the workspace has no external dependencies. Each variant is
//! therefore an ordered list of rules tried at each position — which is what an
//! alternation *is*, so the structure mirrors the regex rather than
//! reinterpreting it.
