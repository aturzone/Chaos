//! The DeepSeek-V4-Flash forward pass, as library code rather than as a test.
//!
//! Every step here was built checkpoint-by-checkpoint against `llama.cpp`'s own
//! element-sums — see `tests/deepseek4_forward.rs`, which now checks *this*
//! code rather than a copy of it. That distinction matters: the port spent its
//! first weeks with the implementation living inside the test, which meant the
//! library shipped nothing and the verification proved only that the test
//! agreed with itself.
//!
//! # What is verified, and at which prompt length
//!
//! **Prompt length decides which code paths run**, because the compressed
//! attention builders are guarded on their compressed caches being non-empty.
//! The same layer runs different attention at different lengths:
//!
//! | tokens | layers 0-1 | even layers | odd layers |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | ≤3 | Raw | Raw (fallback) | Raw (fallback) |
//! | 5 | Raw | Compressed Sparse | Raw (fallback) |
//! | ≥128 | Raw | Compressed Sparse | Heavily Compressed |
//!
//! All three are checked against llama.cpp: the whole 43-block stack at 2
//! tokens, and layers 0-3 at 165 where both compressed kinds fire.
//!
//! # The one deliberate omission
//!
//! **The lightning indexer is not run**, and below ~2048 tokens that is exact
//! rather than approximate: `n_top_k = min(n_lid, indexer_top_k)` selects
//! *every* compressed slot, so the indexer's mask is precisely the visibility
//! mask and cannot change any output. Above that length this becomes an
//! approximation and [`Deepseek4Forward::indexer_is_exact`] returns false.

/// cost: `layer_tail` plus `moe_routing` measured 0.06s per block for a handful
/// of normalisations and a top-6 sort.
///
/// So a value is computed only where the **CPU** must read it: before a
/// `to_vec_*` or a `set_*` that consumes it. Everything else stays a graph node
/// and is evaluated once, as part of whichever sync point subsumes it.
///
/// The genuine sync points in a block are: `kv_full` (attention builds an F16

/// `topk` (routing decides which expert slices to read from disk, so it cannot
/// be deferred), and the block's own output.
/// How often each expert of each layer is actually selected.
///
/// The whole streaming budget rests on an assumption nobody has checked: that a
/// token's 6-of-256 choice is spread evenly, so 137 GiB of experts are all
/// equally cold and none is worth holding in RAM. **If routing is skewed
