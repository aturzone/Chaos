//! Three-axis rotary positions for the denoiser, and the table they become.
//!
//! # Why an image needs three position axes
//!
//! A language model's token has one position. A denoiser's token is either a
//! word or a *patch of an image*, and a patch has a row and a column that both
//! matter. Ideogram 4 gives every token three coordinates — `(t, y, x)` — and
//! splits the rotary frequencies between them.
//!
//! Text tokens get `(i, i, i)`: all three axes agree, which makes the rotation
//! for a word identical to ordinary 1-D RoPE. Image tokens get
//! `(OFFSET, OFFSET + y, OFFSET + x)` with `OFFSET = 65536`, far past any text
//! length, so no patch can be confused with a word.
//!
//! # The interleave, which is the part that is easy to get wrong
//!
//! The frequencies are **not** split into three contiguous blocks. They are
//! dealt out round-robin: frequency `f` belongs to axis `f % 3`, and only while
//! `f < 3 * section[axis]`. Past that every remaining frequency falls back to
//! the time axis. With sections `[24, 20, 20]` over 128 frequency pairs that is
//! 20 for `y`, 20 for `x`, and **88** for `t` — not 24, because `t` also
//! collects everything above 60.
//!
//! A contiguous split gives a table of the same shape, full of finite numbers,
//! and an image whose left half does not know about its right half. This is the
//! reason this module exists separately and is tested on its own.
//!
//! # What comes out
//!
//! A flat `[2, 2, head_dim / 2, positions]` buffer in ggml order: a 2x2 rotation
//! matrix `[cos, -sin, sin, cos]` for every (position, frequency-pair). The
//! denoiser multiplies rather than calling `ggml_rope`, because no ggml rope
//! mode implements this interleave.
