//! A model on disk: several GGUF shards, resolved into one addressable set of
//! tensors.
//!
//! # What this solves
//!
//! A large model ships as `name-00001-of-00005.gguf` .. `-00005-of-00005.gguf`.
//! Each shard is a self-contained GGUF with its own header and its own tensor
//! index covering only the tensors it holds, and every offset in that index is
//! relative to *that shard's* data section. Nothing in the format gives you a
//! single view of the model.
//!
//! [`Model`] builds that view: one name-to-location map across every shard, so
//! callers ask for `blk.7.ffn_gate_exps.weight` and get bytes, without knowing
//! which file it lives in or where the data section starts.
//!
//! # Working with an incomplete download
//!
//! GGUF puts the header and tensor index at the *start* of each shard, so a
//! partially-downloaded shard still has a complete, parseable index. That is
//! genuinely useful: the full layout of a 144 GiB model can be known — and
//! planned against — while it is still downloading. [`Model::open`] therefore
//! accepts shards it cannot fully read, and [`Model::availability`] reports
//! which tensors are actually resident on disk right now.
