"""Build `assets/chaos.ico` from `assets/logo.svg`.

Windows shows a blank default icon for an executable that carries none, which
is what "empty shapes" looked like on the setup, the app, the taskbar and the
Start Menu entry.

**Every size is rasterised from the vector at its own resolution.** Windows does
not downsample well: the shell asks for 16 px for a title bar and 256 px for the
Alt-Tab view, and a single 256 squeezed to 16 turns this logo -- which is mostly
fine radiating lines -- into grey mush. Nine sizes, nine renders.

Separate from `rasterise-logo.py` rather than bolted onto it: that script owns
the terminal bitmap and the README image, and its `main()` is already doing two
jobs. This imports its geometry rather than copying it, so there is still one
definition of how the logo is drawn.

No dependencies, like everything else here -- `struct` and `zlib` are standard
library, and the ICO container is a header, a directory and the PNGs.
