//! Which Chaos release is newest, and which file this platform needs.
//!
//! Atur: *"users can get the most updated release when they connect to the
//! internet from the app -- an updating flow, not every time go and download a
//! new setup. For all apps and exports we need."*
//!
//! Here rather than in `chaos-app` because of that last sentence. The window is
//! one of twelve binaries a release ships, and a CLI user who never opens it
//! needs the same answer -- `chaos-run --update`. `chaos-model` is the crate
//! both already depend on, and the crate that already owns the other thing that
//! talks to the network and downloads a file (`chaos-pull`).
//!
//! # What is here and what is not
//!
//! **The decisions are pure and tested; the one call that reaches the internet
//! is a `curl` invocation kept to a single function.** Everything else is a
//! function of a version string or a blob of JSON, so all of it runs in CI --
//! the comparison that decides whether to offer an update, the asset name for
//! the platform, and the parse of the releases feed.
//!
//! That split is deliberate. The interesting failures are "0.0.9 looked newer
//! than 0.0.11" and "downloaded the macOS tarball onto Windows", and neither of
//! those needs a socket to reproduce.
//!
//! # What an update is
//!
//! Chaos ships one installer per platform, and it carries **every** binary --
//! the window, `chaos-run`, `chaos-serve` and the rest. So one update updates
//! all of them, and the flow is *fetch the right asset and run it* rather than
//! a bespoke patching mechanism. The Windows installer already knows how to
//! upgrade in place: it reports "Reinstalling" or "UPDATE", and it leaves the
//! models directory alone.

/// A released version, compared the way people expect.
///
/// **String comparison is wrong and looks right for a long time.** `"0.0.9"` is
/// greater than `"0.0.11"` alphabetically, so a user on 0.0.9 would be told
/// they were up to date, and one on 0.0.11 would be offered a downgrade —
/// silently, and only once the tenth release existed.
