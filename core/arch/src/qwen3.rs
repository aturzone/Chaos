//! * **Per-head Q/K normalisation.** Qwen3 RMS-normalises each attention head
//!   *before* RoPE, using a weight of `head_dim`, not `n_embd`. Skipping it,
//!   or applying it across the whole vector, changes every attention score.
//! * **NeoX-style RoPE.** Rotation pairs dimension `i` with `i + head_dim/2`,
//!   not with `i + 1`. The other convention is also "valid RoPE" and produces
//!   plausible output, so this cannot be caught by eyeballing results.
//!
//! The MoE variant differs only in the feed-forward block: a router picks
//! `n_expert_used` of `n_expert`, and `mul_mat_id` applies just those.
