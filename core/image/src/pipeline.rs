//! Prompt in, pixels out: the four models in the order they run.
//!
//! ```text
//! text  ->  Qwen3-VL-8B      13 layers of hidden states
//!           Ideogram 4       34 layers, once per step, conditioned
//!           Ideogram 4 uncond  34 layers, once per step, no text at all
//!           FLUX.2 decoder   latent -> RGB
//! ```
//!
//! # Why the unconditional pass is a second 5.26 GiB model
//!
//! Classifier-free guidance needs an answer to "what would you draw with no
//! prompt?" Most models get it by running the same weights on an empty string.
//! Ideogram 4 ships a **separately trained set of weights** for it, run with no
//! text tokens in the sequence at all — not an empty prompt, no prompt. That is
//! why [`Pipeline`] holds two denoisers and why a step costs two forward passes
//! over two different containers.
//!
//! # What one image costs
//!
//! Every byte of both denoisers is read on every step: a diffusion transformer
//! is dense, so there is no routed-expert set to skip. That is 10.5 GiB of
//! reads per step before any arithmetic, and the arithmetic is
//! `2 x tokens x 9e9` multiply-adds twice over. The token count is the lever
//! that matters — it is quadratic in the image's width — which is why
//! [`Request::grid`] exists and why a small image is not merely faster but
//! *differently* feasible.
//!
//! # Memory
//!
//! Each stage opens its own containers and closes them: the text encoder is
//! finished with before the first denoiser opens. Nothing here holds two models
//! resident at once, because 4.68 + 5.26 + 5.26 GiB does not fit on the machine
//! this was written on.
