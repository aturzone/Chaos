> ## SUPERSEDED — retired 2026-08-31, kept for the reasoning only
>
> **This epic describes a product that no longer exists.** It was written when
> Chaos was to be a Python wrapper driving someone else's engine — SGLang or
> ktransformers — on Linux with an NVIDIA card. `decisions/stack.md` was accepted
> on 2026-08-03 and settled the opposite: *"Chaos is *the runner*, not a front-end
> that shells out to someone else's."* What shipped is a Rust workspace with
> **zero third-party dependencies**, running on Windows against Vulkan.
>
> It stayed `status: open` for four weeks after that decision, and an audit on
> 2026-08-31 found that these five files together carried **26 tickets counted as
> outstanding work**. Any percentage-complete figure that included them was wrong
> by about twenty points, in the direction that makes a project look worse than it
> is — which is its own kind of dishonesty.
>
> **Do not schedule anything here.** Some of the *questions* are still good; where
> one is, it has been re-asked in a live node. This file is history.
## Tickets
- [ ] T0 (GATE — narrowed by Atur 2026-07-28: blocks T4/T5 only): Runtime-verify whether kt-kernel's SGLang integration preserves SGLang's ExpertDistributionRecorder end-to-end for CPU-offloaded experts, or bypasses it — depends: ../decisions/fork-vs-wrapper.md — evidence: ../research/licensing-fork-vs-wrapper.md (Open questions, item 1) — acceptance: a documented runtime test showing recorder output is populated (or provably absent) while kt-kernel executes the expert FFN path, committed as a short report linked from this epic.
- [ ] T1: Add a preflight installer/toolchain check that detects missing CUDA compiler, missing libhwloc, insufficient GLIBCXX version, and Windows install-script failures before a build starts, printing one specific remediation step per detected issue — depends: ../decisions/fork-vs-wrapper.md — evidence: ../research/ktransformers-vs-llamacpp-moe-offload-gaps.md — acceptance: on a machine missing a required toolchain component, the check reports the specific missing component and fix instead of a raw build error.
- [ ] T2: Build an offload auto-split recommendation tool that, given detected VRAM/RAM and a model's tensor layout, outputs a specific CPU/GPU split a user can apply manually to whichever backend they run — depends: ../decisions/fork-vs-wrapper.md — evidence: ../research/ktransformers-vs-llamacpp-moe-offload-gaps.md — acceptance: given the same VRAM/RAM/model inputs, the tool returns an identical split recommendation across three consecutive runs.
- [ ] T3: Add a batch-size vs. offload-split budget check that warns when a requested prompt-processing batch size would push the recommended split past available VRAM — depends: ../decisions/fork-vs-wrapper.md — evidence: ../research/ktransformers-vs-llamacpp-moe-offload-gaps.md — acceptance: requesting a batch size that exceeds remaining VRAM after the recommended split triggers a warning before launch, not an OOM crash during inference.
- [ ] T4: Expose a per-expert activation/routing count metric for MoE decode, broken out by expert ID and layer — depends: ../decisions/fork-vs-wrapper.md — evidence: ../research/ktransformers-vs-llamacpp-moe-offload-gaps.md — acceptance: after a serving session, querying the metrics output returns a non-zero activation count for at least one specific expert ID.
- [ ] T5: Expose a CPU-to-GPU expert-transfer cache-hit-rate metric for the offloaded-expert decode path — depends: ../decisions/fork-vs-wrapper.md — evidence: ../research/ktransformers-vs-llamacpp-moe-offload-gaps.md — acceptance: the metric reports a higher hit-rate percentage on a second identical prompt than on the first cold-cache prompt.
- [ ] T6 (re-scoped per ADR): Build a concurrent-serving regression harness against the SGLang + kt-kernel serving path (balance_serve is archived upstream) that replays a long-prompt-then-short-follow-up pattern across N simulated users and flags any inter-request stall past a set threshold — depends: ../decisions/fork-vs-wrapper.md — evidence: ../research/licensing-fork-vs-wrapper.md — acceptance: the harness fails the run when a follow-up response takes longer than the configured threshold after a large prior prompt, and passes when it doesn't.
- [ ] T7: Document and script a NUMA-aware launch wrapper for dual-socket/multi-channel-RAM hosts running CPU-offloaded MoE inference — depends: ../decisions/fork-vs-wrapper.md — evidence: ../research/ktransformers-vs-llamacpp-moe-offload-gaps.md — acceptance: on a NUMA host, tokens/sec measured with the wrapper is higher than the unwrapped baseline on the same model and split.
