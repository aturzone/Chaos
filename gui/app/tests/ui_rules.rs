//! The app's rules, tested where they can be.
//!
//! A Win32 window cannot be unit-tested: there is no way to assert that a
//! button looks pressed. What *can* be tested is everything the window decides
//! before it draws -- which page owns a control, which rows to show, what the
//! endpoint is, which files a delete would remove -- and that is where the bugs
//! have actually been.
//!
//! **This file also encodes the two rules that are invisible at runtime**, as
//! source checks rather than assertions:
//!
//! 1. No Win32 call while `UI` is mutably borrowed. The failure is a `RefCell`
//!    double borrow under `panic = "abort"`: instant, silent process death that
//!    no harness can observe.
//! 2. No colour named outside `theme.rs`. The failure is not a crash at all --
//!    it is a palette that cannot be changed, which is how the previous window
//!    ended up with controls that ignored the theme.
