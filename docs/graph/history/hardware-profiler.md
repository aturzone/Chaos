epic: hardware-profiler
status: superseded 2026-08-31 by decisions/stack.md
note: config-recommendation output overlaps ktransformers' Q2 2026 roadmap — deconflict with upstream before building a competing recommender (../decisions/fork-vs-wrapper.md)

> ## SUPERSEDED — retired 2026-08-31, kept for the reasoning only
>
> **This epic describes a product that no longer exists.** It was written when
> Chaos was to be a Python wrapper driving someone else's engine — SGLang or
> ktransformers — on Linux with an NVIDIA card. `decisions/stack.md` was accepted
> on 2026-08-03 and settled the opposite: *"Chaos is *the runner*, not a front-end
> that shells out to someone else's."* What shipped is a Rust workspace with
> **zero third-party dependencies**, running on Windows against Vulkan.
>
> It stayed `status: open` for four weeks after that decision, and an audit on
> 2026-08-31 found that these five files together carried **26 tickets counted as
> outstanding work**. Any percentage-complete figure that included them was wrong
> by about twenty points, in the direction that makes a project look worse than it
> is — which is its own kind of dishonesty.
>
> **Do not schedule anything here.** Some of the *questions* are still good; where
> one is, it has been re-asked in a live node. This file is history.
## Tickets
- [ ] T1: Implement a portable STREAM-Triad-based RAM bandwidth probe that completes in under 20 seconds and reports sustained MB/s independent of host OS — depends: ../decisions/fork-vs-wrapper.md — evidence: ../research/hardware-profiling.md — acceptance: running the probe three consecutive times on the same idle machine returns bandwidth values within 5% of each other.
- [ ] T2: Implement a cross-platform VRAM-capacity + GPU-model-string probe (vendor CLI / DXGI / sysfs fallback) that completes in under 5 seconds without running a compute benchmark — depends: ../decisions/fork-vs-wrapper.md — evidence: ../research/hardware-profiling.md — acceptance: the probe returns a non-zero VRAM total and a GPU model string on an NVIDIA target, an AMD target, and a Windows-DXGI-only target.
- [ ] T3: Implement a fio-based 4K random-read probe (QD32, direct I/O) against a scratch file in the user-selected target model-storage directory, completing in under 30 seconds — depends: ../decisions/fork-vs-wrapper.md — evidence: ../research/hardware-profiling.md — acceptance: pointing the probe at a non-writable path produces an explicit failure/warning instead of a silent wrong number, and a writable target drive returns an IOPS/MB/s figure.
- [ ] T4: Implement a memory-bound decode tokens/sec ceiling model driven by active-params-per-token and KV-cache-bytes-per-token, with the KV term parameterized by attention architecture (MHA/GQA/MLA) rather than a flat per-param heuristic — depends: ../decisions/fork-vs-wrapper.md — evidence: ../research/hardware-profiling.md — acceptance: given identical active-param, KV-cache-bytes, and bandwidth inputs, the model returns the same tok/s ceiling across repeated runs, and a different value when the architecture parameter changes.
- [ ] T5: Implement a prefill/TTFT compute-bound estimator, kept as a separate callable model from the decode estimator — depends: ../decisions/fork-vs-wrapper.md — evidence: ../research/hardware-profiling.md — acceptance: for one fixed model/hardware input set, the prefill estimator and the decode estimator (T4) are invokable independently and return distinct numbers with distinct units/semantics.
- [ ] T6: Implement a mixed-tier (VRAM+RAM) offload prediction model that takes per-tier bandwidth plus a PCIe-transfer correction term and returns steady-state decode tok/s for a given expert-placement split, without assuming any specific offload engine's internal API — depends: ../decisions/fork-vs-wrapper.md — evidence: ../research/hardware-profiling.md — acceptance: given two different CPU/GPU expert-placement splits for the same model and hardware inputs, the model returns two different tok/s predictions.
- [ ] T7: Build a calibration/validation harness that runs the prediction models' inputs against a set of logged real ktransformers/llama.cpp benchmark runs and reports per-run prediction error — depends: ../decisions/fork-vs-wrapper.md — evidence: ../research/hardware-profiling.md — acceptance: the harness outputs a numeric error (MAE or %-error) for every logged calibration run without manual recalculation.
