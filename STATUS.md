# STATUS — where Chaos is, and what is left

**Read this first, in any session.** It is the single place that says what is
true today. Update it in the same commit as any change that moves a number or
closes a task; if it disagrees with a doc, this file is wrong and the doc is
right, so fix this file.

## The broken desktop app: reproduced, half fixed (2026-08-28)

Atur's report of 2026-08-27 — the installed app badly broken, "mode selection
got mixed up inside the application" — **is reproduced on the installed build
and was two defects, not one.** Full account:
`docs/graph/research/desktop-app-broken-2026-08-28.md`.

**Fixed and measured.** `WM_CREATE` called `show_page(Page::Chat)` while
`ui.launched` was still `false`, so the window opened with the mode knob painted
*underneath* nine real child HWNDs — the chat transcript, its composer, SEND,
CLEAR, the four rail buttons and STOP. `WM_PAINT` stops at `paint_launch`, but
painting the knob cannot cover a child window. On-screen controls at open, by
client-rect: **9 before, 0 after**; RETURN still brings all 9 up, and ESC still
returns to the knob. ESC doing nothing at open is what proves `launched` was
false. Guard added inside `show_page` so every route in is covered, hiding shared
with `back_to_knob`, and a regression test asserts the guard precedes the first
`SW_SHOW`.

**The plan's §0b description was stale**, and this answers its third
deliverable: the desktop already asks the mode once, on a launch screen
(`paint_launch`, `knob.rs`), exactly like the phone. It just did not own the
window.

**Decided by Atur on 2026-08-28: asked once, then remembered.** The knob showed
on every launch because `launched` started `false` and nothing consulted the
saved `role`. It now starts from a new `mode_chosen` setting — `role` cannot
carry that answer, because its default is a real role and a machine nobody asked
reads the same as one whose owner chose ALONE. ESC still returns to the knob, so
remembering is not a trap. Measured on the real window:

| launch | `mode_chosen` | controls on-screen at open | |
|---|---|---|---|
| first | absent | **0** — the knob has the window | RETURN enters, and the file gains `mode_chosen = true` |
| second | `true` | **9** — straight into the saved mode | ESC still goes back to the knob |

**An existing settings.txt has no `mode_chosen` key, so everyone upgrading is
asked exactly once more and then remembered.** That is the intended migration.
The window also now opens on the first page the mode can *reach*, not on CHAT
unconditionally — `pages_for(Helper)` has no CHAT, so a remembered HELPER would
otherwise have raised a page its own rail cannot reach.

**RETRACTED, same day: "the CHAOS page arrives blank" was my probe, not the
app.** The page works. `GetWindowTextW` called from another process does not send
`WM_GETTEXT` — documented and deliberate, so a hung target cannot hang the
caller — so it returns only a window's *caption*. A BUTTON's label **is** its
caption, which is why every earlier transcript looked fine; an EDIT's text is
not, so every EDIT read as empty however full it was. Read with `WM_GETTEXT`,
764/765/769 hold `127.0.0.1:8231`, the key, and 105 characters of guidance. The
marker that "survived" was a field only the probe had ever written: a
cross-process `SetWindowTextW` sets the caption, so the probe read back its own
write while the app's in-process write went to the edit buffer where the probe
could not see it. A file trace inside `fill_chaos_fields` settled it. Two
candidates were eliminated first and cheaply: exactly one top-level
`ChaosAppWindow`, and no duplicate control ids among 56 children.
`run-through.ps1` had the same bug in its `TextOf` and now sends `WM_GETTEXT`.

## The CLI became a tier: `chaos` is the front door (2026-08-28)

Atur, twice: **the CLI must not be a lesser tier.** §3 of the plan listed seven
items; **six are done and measured, one is declared not built.** Full account
with the transcripts: `docs/graph/backlog/cli-first-class-tier.md`.

**`chaos <subcommand>` is the front door, and every old binary name still
works.** `chaos run` *is* `chaos-run`, arguments passed through untouched, so
scripts, docs, the installer's file list and `asset_for_platform` all keep
meaning what they meant. Nothing was renamed; a name was added.

**The settings file is now shared, which was the plan's exact complaint** — *"the
app has a settings file the CLI cannot read"*. `Settings` moved from `gui/app` to
**`core/config`**, and `gui/app` re-exports it, so every `settings::` call site in
the window is unchanged. `chaos start` builds the server's flags with
`Settings::serve_args`, the same function the window calls, so there is no second
list to drift.

**Measured on a real node** (throwaway `USERPROFILE`, `Llama-3.2-1B`):

| command | result |
|---|---|
| `chaos start Llama-3.2-1B` | pid 23660, reachable in ~1 s |
| `chaos status` | model, route, context 2048, off-loopback false — **no curl** |
| `chaos connect 127.0.0.1:8231 "Name one colour…"` | streamed `Red`, key from settings |
| `chaos start` again | refuses: already running |
| `chaos stop` / stale pid / no pid | stops; clears; says so. Exit codes distinct |

**Two bugs the measurement caught.** `chaos start` reported success over a node
that had already exited — it now waits 600 ms and prints the exit code and the
log's tail. And the first liveness check was wrong on Windows in a way that looked
right: **`OpenProcess` succeeds on an exited process while any handle is open**,
and the parent held one, so `alive()` returned true for a dead child.
`Child::try_wait` is authoritative; `alive()` now requires `STILL_ACTIVE`.

**`chaos scan` is NOT BUILT and says so.** `core/qr` encodes only. Decoding a
photograph is thresholding, finder detection, a perspective basis, de-masking and
Reed-Solomon *correction*, and every stage fails by returning a plausible wrong
string. The command is listed as `NOT BUILT` and names the two readers that work.

**`chaos-qr` was in no ship list at all** — the brand tier claims it reaches a
bare terminal and the binary was never packaged. It and `chaos` are now in the
release workflow's three staging lists and in `make-linux-packages.sh`. **Not yet
through a tag**, so no published archive contains them.

**`cargo install --path cli/chaos` works, and needs no ggml**: the front door,
the settings reader, the HTTP client and the JSON parser all build with
`GGML_LIB_DIR` unset, and CI now checks all four. Completions generate for bash,
zsh, fish and powershell from one list — **generated and asserted, never sourced
into a real shell**, which is the honest limit.

## The secure-context question is decided (2026-08-28)

§1 asked for a deliberate answer and got one: **accept the limit. The mark is
universal; the reader is a phone feature.** No code changed — the page already
fails with the reason, which is why this costs nothing. A self-signed certificate
would put a security warning in front of a stranger's first contact with Chaos;
`localhost`-only would make the reader work on the machine least likely to need
it. `docs/graph/research/secure-context-decision-2026-08-28.md` has the reasoning
and what would reopen it (a real iOS need, which is still unanswered).

**`--emit-pages` has now run** for the first time, and its output is measured
rather than trusted: `qr.html` 362,804 bytes and `scan.html` 228,348 bytes, with
**0 `<link>`, 0 `src=`, 0 `@import`, 0 `fetch`/XHR, and 6 `@font-face` each, all
as `data:` URIs**. The only `http` strings in either are an SVG namespace and the
repository link, neither of which is a fetch.

## CHAOS left the menu, and the mode moved to the rail (2026-08-28)

Atur, on the fix above: *"why is the CHAOS option in the app's menu list? it is
chosen the first time the app opens, and after that at the bottom left of the app
we should show the mode + a CHANGE MODE button ... get accept after clicking
CHANGE ... if not, stay in the current mode, because maybe the user already ran a
model or gave it a prompt, and changing mode stops all current work"*.

He was pointing at a real duplication: the mode was answered by the launch knob
**and** offered again as a whole destination in the rail.

- **CHAOS is no longer a rail page.** `nav::RAIL_PAGES` is the five a person
  navigates to; `nav::PAGES` is still all six, because CHAOS still exists and
  still owns controls. It is reached from the mode badge.
- **The four ALONE/CORE/HELPER/CLIENT buttons are gone from the page.** The knob
  answers the mode; the badge reports it. `Weight::Radio` went with them, since a
  never-constructed variant is a `-D warnings` failure.
- **The mode block sits at the bottom of the rail**: `ALONE` (the badge, which
  opens the CHAOS page) over `CHANGE MODE`.
- **Leaving a mode asks first, and so does Escape.** Escape has gone straight to
  the knob since the knob existed, so one keystroke could unload a model and
  clear a conversation with nothing asked. Both doors now call
  `confirm_leaving_mode`, which names what will be lost — the loaded model, the
  number of exchanges, an unsent prompt — and defaults to staying.
- **CHAOS was fourth in `PAGES`, so removing it from the menu would have left
  `Ctrl+4` dead while `Ctrl+5` and `Ctrl+6` worked.** It is last now, and the
  rail's accelerators are a contiguous `Ctrl+1..5`.

Measured on the real window, not reasoned about:

| step | result |
|---|---|
| badge label | `ALONE` — upper case at the point of display, `alone` still in settings.txt |
| press the badge | CHAT controls 4 → 0, CHAOS controls 0 → **5** |
| CHANGE MODE | modal appears: *"Leave ALONE mode? … You will be taken back to the mode dial."* |
| answer **No** | **5 controls still on-screen** — still in the mode, nothing stopped |
| answer **Yes** | 8 → **0** on-screen: the knob owns the window |
| RETURN | 8 back |

`run-through.ps1` covers the new block and lists CHANGE MODE as blocking, since a
modal stops the message loop the script drives.

**The run-through reported a clean pass over the broken app**: 22 controls, worst
blocking call 48.5 ms. It drives pages by `WM_COMMAND`, so it walked an app that
had never left its launch screen. It now presses RETURN first and *stops* if no
rail button is on-screen, and it covers the **CHAOS page**, which it never did.
The two brand buttons have now been clicked for the first time — with no address
set they correctly open nothing, 3.8 ms and 0.5 ms.

**v0.0.21 verified from its own published files.** The APK was downloaded from
the release and opened: `lib/arm64-v8a/libchaos_serve.so` (3,245,872 bytes — the
engine), `libchaos_android.so` (the bridge) and `knob_badge.png` at every
density are all inside it.


**v0.0.20 verified from its own published files.** The APK was downloaded from
the release and **`lib/arm64-v8a/libchaos_android.so` is inside it at 479,664
bytes** — checked in the published artefact rather than inferred from its size.
On the desktop: v0.0.19 installed, updated to v0.0.20 unattended through the
app's own updater, uninstalled clean, and `~/.chaos/models` identical at 18
files and 120,933,521,300 bytes.

**v0.0.19 verified from its own published files**: v0.0.18 installed, updated to
v0.0.19 **unattended** through the app's own updater — the first release where
`--update --yes` carried an upgrade end to end — uninstalled clean, and
`~/.chaos/models` identical at 18 files and 120,933,521,300 bytes.

**v0.0.18 verified from its own published files**: v0.0.17 installed, updated
to v0.0.18 through the app's own updater, uninstalled clean, and
`~/.chaos/models` identical at 18 files and 120,933,521,300 bytes. The CHAOS
page works in the installed build -- ALONE and CORE both persist, worst
blocking call 16.7 ms.

## The mark reaches every tier, and the reader was broken at close range (2026-08-27)

**The brand mark and the reader are one source of truth, served by the node.**
`assets/grimoire/grimoire.html` (the burning book, whose open pages are this
node's route as a QR code) and `assets/grimoire/scanner.html` (the same rune
circle as a viewfinder, with its own QR detector) are now compiled into the
server and reach the browser, the desktop window, the phone and a bare terminal
without being reimplemented anywhere.

### What each tier got

| Tier | What it shows | How |
|---|---|---|
| `chaos-serve` | `GET /qr`, `GET /scan`, `GET /status` | `include_str!` of the two files, wrapped into a real document by `chaos_arch::grimoire` |
| Desktop (`gui/app`) | SHOW THE MARK / READ A CODE on the CHAOS page | `shell_open` of the node's `/qr?theme=` — see below |
| Android | MARK / SCAN buttons, a WebView over an origin the app answers itself | `BrandActivity`, assets first then the node |
| **CLI, no GUI** | the route drawn as a scannable code in the terminal | new `core/qr` crate + `chaos-qr`; `chaos-serve` prints it at startup when the node is reachable |

**The desktop opens the served page rather than drawing it natively, and that is
a decision.** That window is Win32 with GDI painting and no webview; adding one
would be the largest dependency in the workspace, on a platform-specific
runtime, to re-render something the server already serves. Opening the URL means
the window, the phone and a stranger's browser see the same bytes.

**The fonts are embedded, because the pages used to fetch them.** Cinzel, IBM
Plex Mono and UnifrakturMaguntia are 134 KB of WOFF2 in
`assets/grimoire/fonts.css`, generated by `scripts/embed-fonts.py`, licences in
`assets/grimoire/fonts/NOTICE`. Chaos downloads nothing on its own and a `<link>`
to a font CDN was the single exception — one that fails exactly where it is most
wanted, on a machine with no route out and on a LAN-only node. A test asserts the
assembled page has no fetchable external reference left: **0 `<link>` elements,
6 font faces loaded, 0 network requests**, measured in a browser.

### The terminal code, and how it is known to be right

`core/qr` is a second QR encoder — the browser has one and a terminal cannot run
JavaScript. The risk is paid for rather than argued away:

- **Bit-for-bit identical to the page's encoder** across nine payloads covering
  versions 1-6 and multi-byte UTF-8 (`core/qr/tests/reference-grids.txt`, cut by
  `scripts/qr-fixture.py`).
- Every one of those grids goes back through `assets/grimoire/decode_qr.py`,
  written from the reading side, and must return its exact payload. **All
  syndromes zero, all nine.**
- `python-qrcode` produces the identical grid on six of the nine. On the other
  three it picks a **different mask**; scored against ISO 18004's four rules by a
  third implementation, ours is the better choice every time — **311 against
  416** on `"hi"`, 334 against 436, 296 against 325. Both decode; mask choice is
  a quality heuristic, not correctness.
- End to end: `chaos-qr "http://192.168.1.20:8080" --ascii`, its own terminal
  output parsed back into a grid, decoded by the independent decoder — **exact
  payload, every syndrome zero.**

### The reader was broken exactly where it would be used most

The scanner's earlier measurement — "15/15 across 4/6/8 px per module" — was
true and **did not cover the case that matters**. Above about ten pixels a
module it stopped reading, which is what happens the moment the phone is close
enough that the code fills the ring. Three separate causes, each found by
measuring a stage rather than looking at the picture:

1. **A code carries no more information at twelve pixels a module than at six**,
   and the local threshold's eight-pixel blocks break a large module into
   speckle. `readFrame` now tries full size, then halves, until it reads or the
   frame is under 180 px. 7 of 18 scales read before, **15 of 18** after.
2. **The right three finder candidates were not always in the top five.**
   Triples are now filtered geometrically — legs equal, hypotenuse root two
   longer, module sizes within a factor of two — so eight candidates can be
   considered for the price of arithmetic instead of grid samples.
3. **The finder centre itself was up to four pixels out.** Rows are scanned
   every second row, and the set of rows passing the ratio test is not symmetric
   about the middle once the code is turned. Four pixels is a 1.5° error in the
   sampling basis, which over 29 modules puts the far edge most of a module out.
   The centre is now taken as the midpoint of the pattern's full extent, twice,
   alternating axes.

**A ten-degree band around 90° failed at every scale and 85° and 270° were
fine.** That is the bug an angle sweep in multiples of 45 would never find.

### Measured after the fix

- **210 of 210**: 7 scales (3-20 px/module) × 30 angles including 88, 89, 89.5,
  90, 90.5, 91, 92, 95.
- **The rendered artwork**, not a synthetic grid: read at every width from
  1600 px down to 120 px. Fails at 100 px (~2.4 px/module). Before: only at or
  below 400 px.
- Blur to **3.0 px** (was 2.5). Contrast down to `#606060` on `#9a9a9a` (was
  `#404040` on `#c0c0c0`). Quiet zone down to **zero** modules.
- **0 false positives on 40 noise frames**, `null` on a blank.
- At the working size the camera path actually uses (520 px long edge):
  **median 22 ms, max 40 ms** against a 120 ms interval.

**Still unproven: a real camera.** There is none in this environment, so
`getUserMedia` is exercised only down its failure paths — which do distinguish
the two real causes, a non-secure origin and a refused permission. The Android
reader is written against that and **cannot be built here**: `dl.google.com`
404s this whole network, so the SDK will not install and CI is the only build.

## A model runs on the phone, and the four modes are real (2026-08-26)

**889 tests.** Atur: *"android can not do any one of works in windows and just
can connect windows"*. He was right — the dial offered four modes and only
CLIENT did anything. On an Android 34 emulator, with no PC involved:

```
you
What is the capital of France?

chaos
The capital of France is Paris.

7 tokens in 1.8s (3.938 tok/s), finish=stop
POST /v1/chat/completions -> 200 (stream) in 3.2s
```

**`chaos-serve` is a library now.** `network/serve/src/main.rs` became `lib.rs`
plus a thin `src/bin/chaos-serve.rs` that is the only thing parsing arguments.
Everything the phone needed already existed there, and the Kotlin client already
spoke to it, so no second token loop had to be written against JNI.

### The engine is a child process, not a loaded library

Loading it into the app worked for anything that did not make a thread. **The
moment `StreamingRunner::new` called `pthread_create` the app died with
SIGSEGV/SEGV_ACCERR inside `__init_tcb`.** A 16 MiB stack did not help; moving
the call to a JVM thread did not help — the crash simply moved deeper, from the
JNI entry to `StreamingRunner`; and `llvm-readelf` shows the library has **no
`PT_TLS` segment**, so TLS is not the cause either.

**The same engine as an executable makes threads perfectly on the same device** —
`chaos-run` was verified doing exactly that in v0.0.19. So Android does what the
desktop window has always done: spawns the server and talks to it over the API.
One architecture, one protocol, and the part that was fighting is gone.

It ships as `libchaos_serve.so` because Android only permits executing a file
from `nativeLibraryDir`, and the manifest asks for native libraries to be
extracted so there is a real file to execute. **CI builds it and greps the
finished APK for it**, because an app that silently cannot run a model is the
state this release exists to end.

### Three things Atur reported about the dial

- **A black surround.** The app's theme is `#0D1117` and a white moulded knob on
  it read as a hole. The dial screen has its own light ground now.
- **Sizes were fixed numbers.** Every one is a dimension resource, with values
  for `sw360dp`, `sw600dp` and `h480dp`.
- **The note said "THIS PHONE IS A CLIENT" in every mode**, including the ones
  where the phone was running a model itself. One line per mode now.

## The machine was measured, and the 20 tok/s target became 5 (2026-08-25)

**The wall had never been measured.** "20 tok/s on V4-Flash is out of reach" had
always been argued from a *fixed cost per token* — which is a measurement of
Chaos, not of the hardware. `chaos-membench` settles it:

```
 threads         GiB/s
       1          17.9
       4          29.3
      16          30.8     <- peak
      20          29.3
```

**30.8 GiB/s.** The DDR5-4800 datasheet says 76.8 GB/s; silicon gives 43% of it,
so quoting the spec would have overstated every bandwidth budget by 2.3x.

**The law**, across nine models spanning 23x in size — `resident GiB × tok/s` is
constant at ~19 GiB/s:

```
tok/s ≈ 19 / resident GiB
```

Generation therefore runs at **65% of this machine's peak**, which is respectable
for a dequantising matmul and is not where a 40x gap hides.

### What that settles, and what it opens

A V4-Flash token reads **3.22 GiB** of experts (43 blocks × 6 routed × 12.8 MiB,
matching the 3288 MB measured independently in `v4flash-has-no-slack`).

```
20 tok/s  ->  64.4 GiB/s needed      30.8 available   2.1x short
 5 tok/s  ->  16.1 GiB/s needed      30.8 available   fits
```

**20 tok/s needs a memory bus twice as wide as this laptop's** — not a code
change. Corroborated from outside: `kimi-k3-in-c`'s 128 GB workstation, model
entirely in RAM and the disk gone, still takes **5.6 s/token**. Removing the disk
does not rescue a memory-bound problem.

**Atur set the target to 5 tok/s**, which fits. `backlog/the-big-bang-5-tok-s.md`
is the plan, with each rung's arithmetic:

| rung | change | tok/s |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | today | **0.43** |
| 1 | I/O queue depth → full NVMe | 0.96 |
| 2 | + 2-bit experts | 2.21 |
| 3 | + top-3 routing, 29% resident | **5.21** |

**Rung 1 is free** — experts are read at 1.40 GiB/s from a drive that does 3.09
sequential, 45% of it, because 12.8 MiB reads issued one at a time cannot fill an
NVMe's queue. **This is not the read/compute overlap measured at 1.03x**; that
overlapped one read with compute, this is several reads with each other.

**Rungs 2 and 3 change what the model computes** and are gated behind a quality
harness that does not exist yet. A wrong forward pass here produces fluent
nonsense, never a crash.

### Two levers closed by measurement, so nobody re-proposes them

- **Speculative decoding / batching.** Expert reuse between tokens is **~13%**
  (Chaos's own cache). Batching 8 tokens reads ~42 experts instead of 48 — 12%,
  not the 5x the idea needs.
- **Token-id prefetch.** V4-Flash really does select experts by a table lookup on
  the token id (`llama.cpp/src/models/deepseek4.cpp:1147`) — but only for
  `hash_layer_count = 3` of 43 blocks. 7% of the model.

### Where Chaos actually stands against the competition

`kimi-k3-in-c` has 6.8k stars for a 2.78T model at **26.5 s/token** on an 8 GB
laptop — 0.038 tok/s, in seconds per token, from their own README table. Chaos on
this laptop runs **V4-Flash (144 GB) at 2.4 s/token**, 11x faster per token on a
model 11x smaller, **and 20–31 tok/s on models up to ~1 GiB**, which they cannot
do at all. **Neither claim was on the README.** It is now.

## The JNI bridge: the engine runs inside the app (2026-08-25)

**879 tests.** On an Android 34 emulator, read off the running app's own screen:

> **engine 0.0.19 on this phone: 4 threads, 2.4 GiB total, 1.6 GiB available
> [/proc/meminfo]**

That line is produced by **Rust running inside the app process**, calling the
same `core/probe` the desktop uses. `android/jni` is a cdylib; `Engine.kt` loads
it with `System.loadLibrary` and asks it two questions.

**No `jni` crate.** The project has no dependencies and the APK has none; JNI's
ABI is a table of function pointers at fixed indices, and exactly one entry —
`NewStringUTF`, index 167 — is declared, with the padding before it marked as
load-bearing.

**The library is allowed to be absent.** `UnsatisfiedLinkError` is an `Error`,
not an `Exception`, so a `catch (e: Exception)` would have let the app die in a
static initialiser with nothing a user could act on. It is caught, `available`
is false, and the app falls back to Android's own device description and carries
on as a client — which is exactly what every APK CI has published so far does,
because **the `.so` is not committed**: 490 KB per ABI of build output that
nobody can review and that goes stale the moment the Rust changes.
`scripts/build-android-jni.ps1` makes it.

**Two traps, both paid for.**

- **Do not use the NDK's `.cmd` wrapper as the linker for a cdylib.** rustc
  passes `--version-script=<path>` to control exported symbols; cmd.exe mangles
  it and the link dies with `--version-script=...\list"" was unexpected at this
  time`, which names neither Rust nor the NDK. The executables built earlier
  were fine because they never get that flag.
- **A stale string is a lie the app tells.** The CHAOS note still read *"this
  phone cannot be a CORE yet — running a model needs Chaos built for Android,
  which is not done"* while the engine was demonstrably running two lines above
  it. Corrected, and caught only by reading the screen.

**What is left before a phone can be a CORE**: loading a model file and running
the token loop. The bridge is done.

## The three roadmap items that are still open, answered plainly (2026-08-25)

Atur asked for the remaining items *"like 20 token"* not to be forgotten. They
are not. Two of them are open work; **one is closed by measurement and cannot be
delivered on this machine at any effort.**

### 1. V4-Flash at 20 tok/s — closed, with numbers, from both sides

`v4flash-ram-frontier-2026-08-16.md` is `status: resolved`, and this is why:

```
a token = 1.56 s of expert reads + 0.84 s that never touches the disk
20 tok/s = a token in 50 ms
```

**The 0.84 s is arithmetic, not I/O.** With *infinite* RAM and *zero* disk —
every expert resident — this engine on this CPU tops out at **1.19 tok/s**. The
fixed cost alone is **17x** over a 50 ms budget. `-t 2/4/8/16` confirms it is a
floor rather than a knob left wrong.

Separately, 20 tok/s needs **67.7 GB/s** sustained to the expert weights, which
is a GPU-memory specification rather than a RAM purchase.

**So the honest position: buying enough RAM to hold all 144 GB is worth 2.9x,
not 48x.** The measured frontier is 16 GB → 0.42 (measured), 64 GB → 0.55,
128 GB → 0.93, 160 GB → 1.19. Nothing in the code closes a 17x gap in fixed
arithmetic, and **every idea that might have has been measured and failed**:
expert factorisation, contextual sparsity, a pinned hot set, expert-read/compute
overlap (1.03x), `--op-offload` (19% slower), `mul_mat_id` batching on the
streaming path, and porting parallel-experts (V4-Flash's routed arithmetic is
under 5% of a token).

**This item needs a different machine, and `backlog/bigger-machine-prompt.md` is
written and ready for one.** Reporting anything else as progress would need a
measurement, and there is none to have here.

### 6. Devices as resources — half done, and the half that is done is the hard half

`chaos-worker` exists, speaks the protocol, and is measured: a request is 8268
bytes and an answer 49172, which is **38x in favour of sending the work to the
weights** rather than the weights to the work. `network/worker` has 9 tests.

**What is not built is a CORE that routes an expert to a HELPER** — the token
loop still runs every expert locally. The CHAOS page reserves the role and says
so rather than implying otherwise.

Worth restating because it bounds the ambition: four machines get **single-digit
tok/s** on V4-Flash, not 20. The arithmetic is in
`backlog/devices-as-resources.md`.

### 7. Genuinely better than llama.cpp — parity, and a claim needs its command line

Measured 2026-08-16 with both engines alternating in one session: **parity on
everything that streams** — V4-Flash prefill 1640 against 1679 ms/prompt token,
generation 0.394 against 0.39; Qwen3-30B parity on both phases. Behind
**1.20–1.27x** on the dense path when both sides are hand-tuned; ahead **1.23x**
out of the box, because Chaos measures the machine and llama.cpp uses a fixed
default.

**The ranges overlap, so this is not a lead.** A competitive claim is not
citable until the competitor's exact command line and output are in a doc, from
repeats, alternating in one session — and today's `-ngl` ladder is a reminder of
why: a rate measured over 32 tokens is not a constant, and extrapolating one was
wrong by 1.5x within this very session.

## The CHAOS page, and why a phone could never reach the desktop (2026-08-24)

**878 tests.** Atur: *"when i try connect desktop nothing happen"*. Nothing was
broken. **Nothing was listening anywhere a phone could reach.**

`chaos-serve` binds `127.0.0.1` unless told otherwise, and the window passed
`--port` and never `--host`. Every server this app has ever started could answer
only the machine it ran on. The Android testing on 2026-08-24 missed it because
`chaos-serve --host 0.0.0.0 --api-key` was run **by hand** -- a configuration
the app cannot produce.

The **CHAOS page** is where that choice now lives, because the choice is what
this machine *is* to the others:

```
ALONE    only this machine; 127.0.0.1, no route in
CORE     holds the models and answers; 0.0.0.0, others connect here
HELPER   lends its memory and cores to a CORE
CLIENT   uses a CORE elsewhere, loads nothing here
```

CORE **generates** an api key rather than demanding one: `chaos-serve` refuses
`0.0.0.0` without a key and is right to, but refusing is the wrong thing to do
to somebody who has just pressed CORE. Address and key each have COPY, because
they are typed into a phone once.

**Measured end to end**, `chaos-serve` with the arguments the page produces:

```
TCP 0.0.0.0:8231 LISTENING
GET  /v1/models  no key                 -> 401
GET  /v1/models  with the key           -> the model list
POST /v1/chat/completions over the LAN  -> a real answer
```

Every page and every role driven through the real window:
**worst blocking call 20.1 ms.**

**HELPER says out loud that it is not finished.** `chaos-worker` speaks the
protocol and is measured, but a CORE does not route any expert to it yet, so
the role is reserved and does no work.

**Two instruments learned something.** `SHELL_CONTROLS` already carried a
comment saying IMAGE had once been built, laid out and never shown because its
rail button was missing from that list -- and CHAOS was added exactly the same
way. There is now a test: every page's rail button must be shell chrome. And
`poke-app.ps1` sat on a modal dialog for ten minutes looking like a hang; the
app was `Responding=True` and correct the whole time, refusing to load a
half-downloaded model. It now detects `#32770` and says so instead.

## After v0.0.17 — the `-ngl` ladder, and `--auto` picks wrong (2026-08-24)

**873 tests.** The measurement `ngl-partial-offload-2026-08-16.md` listed as
never taken. Qwen3-4B-Q4_K_M, 2.32 GiB, **fits in the RTX 3050's VRAM
entirely** — the favourable case, not a streaming one. 1080-token prompt, best
of two, one session:

```
   ngl  prefill tok/s     gen tok/s    vs ngl 0
     0         77.52          6.39       1.00x     <- CPU only
    24        125.75          4.13       0.65x
    99        137.58          2.92       0.46x     <- all 36 blocks on the card
```

**Prefill 1.77x. Generation never once faster than the CPU, and 2.2x slower
fully resident.** The GPU saves 5.63 ms per prompt token and loses 185.97 ms per
generated token, so **it pays only above a prompt:generation ratio of 33:1** —
summarising a long document qualifies; a chat turn does not.

**Qwen3-8B (4.68 GiB, against 5.11 GiB of VRAM) says the same shape and better
numbers**: prefill **2.31x**, generation **0.58x**, break-even **14:1**. The
bigger model gets more out of the card and loses less, which is the sensible
direction — more arithmetic per byte moved. **Two points are a direction, not a
curve**, and this card cannot hold anything larger, so do not extrapolate a
crossover. What it does establish is that **a constant rule is wrong**: the
break-even moved by more than 2x between two models on one machine.

**`--auto` decides on whether the model fits**, offloads everything, and is 19%
faster at `-n 16` and — measured end to end, not projected — **2.14x slower at
`-n 200`**: 117.0 s against 54.6 s, with `-n` on its own command line. The
projection from the ladder said 41%; **a per-token rate measured over 32 tokens
is not a constant**, and the device path degrades faster than the CPU as the
context grows. Not fixed, and the second model is the reason: the rule it needs is a
function of model size and `-n`, fitted to a measurement `--auto` does not yet
take, not a constant.

**Do not quote the generation row as "the GPU is slower."** VRAM bandwidth is
about 2x this laptop's DDR5, so resident weights should read *faster*. The 2.2x
is per-token overhead in Chaos's Vulkan path, and nobody has looked at why. That
is the open question, not the finding. `research/ngl-ladder-2026-08-24.md`,
`scripts/ngl-ladder.ps1`.

## v0.0.17 — the app runs, a worker exists, and two claims are retracted (2026-08-24)

**871 Rust tests and 9 Kotlin tests at the tag.** Nine assets, from the
annotated tag:

```
Chaos-v0.0.17-android-arm64.apk          0.85 MB
Chaos-v0.0.17-linux-arm64.tar.gz         7.22 MB

chaos_0.0.17_amd64.deb                   5.63 MB
```

### Install -> update -> uninstall, on this machine, from the published files

The plan's last unchecked Part 7 item. `scripts/install-update-uninstall.ps1`
downloads v0.0.16's real installer, installs it, updates it to v0.0.17 through
the app's own updater, removes it, and counts `~/.chaos/models` before and
after:

```
install v0.0.16      13 binaries, version.txt, Start Menu, registry
chaos-run --version  starts, 0.0.16
--update             finds 0.0.17 and downloads it itself
upgrade in place     0.0.17, registry entry updated with it
uninstall            bin, registry entry and shortcut all gone
models               18 files, 120,933,521,300 bytes -- identical
```

**It found that `--update` could not be scripted at all**: the question is read
from stdin, and EOF -- what a script gives by accident -- reads as "no", so the
first run reported *"the update check found the newer release"*, true, while
nothing had been updated. Even answered, it opened the installer's *window* and
exited. `--update --yes` now answers and passes `/S`.

**Three failures in that first run were the harness, not the product**, and
both mistakes are written into the script: `cmd /c "<a command line with quotes
in it>"` silently does nothing, and `Start-Process -Wait` waits for the whole
process tree -- so it sat on the very window `--update` is meant to leave open.
The uninstaller, called directly, removes everything it added and keeps the
models.

### The Android app runs, and running it found four defects

**2026-08-24, on an Android 34 emulator**, against a real `chaos-serve` on the
host with `--host 0.0.0.0 --api-key`:

> **The capital of France is \*\*Paris\*\*.**

The project's own correctness prompt, answered on a phone through this client.
`chaos-serve` logged `GET /v1/models -> 200` and `POST /v1/chat/completions ->
200 (stream)`.

**Every one of these was invisible until it was on a screen**:

| what running it showed | cause |
|---|---|
| "Chaos" twice, stacked | the theme's ActionBar plus the layout's own heading |
| the key field read "API key (required" | CONNECT sits beside it; the hint did not fit |
| a bare `<think>`/`</think>` around the reply | **the tags arrive split across streamed pieces** — Qwen3 emits `<`, `think`, `>` as three tokens — so per-piece filtering sees none of them |
| the address and key were lost | saved in `onPause`, which **never runs when the process is killed** rather than paused |

`ThinkFilter` fixes the third and has nine unit tests, including that the result
does not depend on how the stream was chunked and that an *unterminated* block
is released rather than swallowed. CI runs them.

**How the toolchain was got.** `dl.google.com` still 404s everything, including
through Atur's proxy and against the exact URL `developer.android.com` links to.
But the proxy reached that page, which gave the real filenames, and public
mirrors carry the rest: Tencent for the SDK components, Aliyun for Google's
Maven, `corretto.aws` and `services.gradle.org` directly. **Every SDK component
was verified against Google's own SHA-1** from the repository manifest.

**The mirrors are not in the repository** — `settings.gradle.kts` still names
`google()` and `mavenCentral()`, and the redirection is a local init script.
**CI builds the shipped APK, from Google's own repositories.**

Still not run on real hardware. That is Atur's phone.

### `chaos-worker` — target 6's first step, measured and stopped

A machine that holds expert weights in RAM and answers with activations.
`chaos-run` without a token loop. The plan's own order was protocol, then a
worker that computes, then **measure and stop**; this is all three.

```
request             8268 bytes      scaled to a V4-Flash token:
answer             49172 bytes        on the wire     4.94 MB
round trip         0.838 ms           transmission    39.5 ms  (1 GbE, arithmetic)
                                      protocol cost   36.0 ms  (measured)
                                      replaces      1560.0 ms  of local disk
```

**≈76 ms to replace 1560 ms.** The design holds. Activations over a real TCP
socket are **bit-identical** to the local path.

Three things it does not say: loopback is not a network (a real LAN adds a
round trip 43 times per token); "if the experts are resident" is the whole
condition; and the ceiling has not moved — 0.84 s of every token never touches
disk, so full residency across machines still lands near 1.19 tok/s. **Four
machines get single-digit tok/s, not 20**, and `--help` says so, along with
**"NOTHING CONNECTS TO THIS YET"**.

The differential test found a real bug on the way: `WeightSet::bind` collapses
every dimension past the first, so a stack bound `[n_embd, n_ff, n_held]`
arrives `[n_embd, n_ff * n_held]` and **ggml aborted the whole test binary** two
ops later with no Rust frame.

### Small images are worse because the denoiser is

| size | grid | cos σ=0.25 |
|---|---|---|
| 256 | 16 | **0.8584** |
| 384 | 24 | 0.8976 |
| 512 | 32 | 0.9185 |
| 640 | 40 | 0.9335 |
| 768 | 48 | 0.9408 |
| 1024 | 64 | **0.9466** |

Monotonic. In error terms the direction is **2.65x worse at grid 16 than at grid
64**, before a single sampler step. **So there is no sampler bug to find** —
that was the obvious next move and the measurement removes it. The size labels
say what was measured now.

**The last row was predicted before it could be measured.** 1024 was out of
reach — `vae::encode` builds an unplanned graph at ~48 KiB per input pixel and
asks for 51 GiB — and the node said the curve was saturating and grid 64 should
land near 0.95. `vae::encode_planned` (**1.51 GiB instead of 48.5, and
bit-identical** where both can run) made the measurement possible, and it landed
at 0.9466. An arena limit standing in for a model limit is the worst kind of
missing datum, because it looks like a result.

### Step count changes the picture and never settles

The one lever left after the finding above, and it is not a lever.

**Reconstruction** (noise a known latent at σ=0.6, integrate back): error
**0.3683 at 4 steps against 0.3770 at 50** — flat, slightly backwards, and 50
costs **17x** the time. Sensible for a rectified flow, which is trained to
predict the straight line and would be exact in one step if the model were
perfect.

**Generation** (same starting noise; do two step counts produce the same
latent?): 4 against the default 20 is **cos 0.7447** — different pictures, not a
refinement. And **every adjacent pair sits at ~0.90 wherever you are on the
ladder** (4↔8 0.8895, 8↔20 0.8966, 20↔50 0.9043) while 4↔50 falls to 0.6719. A
converging sampler would have 20 and 50 agreeing far more closely than 4 and 8.
**So no step count is "correct".**

**Then the four renders settled most of it.** One prompt at 4/8/20/50, same
seed, guidance off, in `~/.chaos/images/step-comparison/`:

| steps | time | 1st–99th percentile | spread | edge energy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | 0.2x | 123 – 179 | **56** | 8.11 |
| 8 | 0.4x | 97 – 189 | 92 | 11.11 |
| 20 | 1.0x | 33 – 184 | 151 | 11.86 |
| 50 | 2.5x | 21 – 194 | 173 | 12.35 |

**Four steps confines the whole image to a 56-level grey band out of 255** —
"flat" with a number behind it, and not a matter of taste. Edge energy saturates
early (8.11 → 11.11 from 4 to 8 steps, then a creep) while the range keeps
opening. So **4 is ruled out by measurement, 8 is where somebody looking should
start**, and which of 8/20/50 wins is aesthetic.

**The default was not changed** — contrast rules one option out without ranking
the rest.

**This node nearly shipped the opposite.** It said "if 4 steps looks acceptable,
256×256 gets five times faster" — while `chaos-draw` had already printed sd 12.2
for that render in output that had been read.

**And one run is kept as a lesson rather than deleted.** The same reconstruction
test at σ=0.95 said more steps were dramatically worse and said nothing of the
kind — at 5% signal the model generates rather than reconstructs, so the metric
measured commitment to a *different* picture. Every row scored above 1.0, worse
than predicting zero, which should have stopped the reading before it started.
The tool warns above σ=0.8 now.

### The JSON prompt shape does nothing; it is the sentences

Chaos said in four places that structured JSON prompts condition **3x** more
strongly. That was **one latent**, and the effect varies by a factor of nineteen
between latents. Over eight:

| prompt style | mean effect | vs bare |
|---|---|---|
| bare phrase | 0.39% | 1.0x |
| **wrapped in an empty structured frame** | 0.36% | **0.9x** |
| written out by hand | 4.40% | **11.3x** |

Wrong in both directions: the real effect is **11.3x**, and **the shape itself
contributes nothing**. A button that wrapped a prompt was written, measured, and
**not shipped** — it would have looked like it helped and would not. The README,
`APP.md`, `chaos-draw --help` and the app's own note now say *describe the
picture, do not just name it*.

That is the third one-sample measurement in this project to say something
confident and wrong.

## v0.0.16 — the six things Atur asked for, measured (2026-08-24)

**871 tests.** **Nine assets**, read back off the releases API rather than
predicted from the workflow:

```
Chaos-v0.0.16-android-arm64.apk          0.84 MB   <-- new

```

CI's own check on the Windows runner: *"setup: install / run / uninstall clean,
models untouched"*, 13 binaries installed.

| what he said | what it was | now |
|---|---|---|
| *"installed models load with lag"* | `why_incomplete` on the UI thread: **1885 ms** across 39 models, every switch | **10.8 ms** |
| *"why image generator do not have select model options??"* | four filenames were a constant | a chooser over what is installed |
| *"list of model better management"* | 39 containers, one flat list | sort, filter, search, and a kind per row |
| *"svg logo must be in center"* | **4 of 9 icon sizes a pixel off** | 8 of 9 exact |
| *"i need android app"* | nothing existed | an APK, built by CI |
| R6 self-configuration | device and cache only | threads, batch, I/O, and a tok/s prediction |

**The tab stall, before and after, same harness, same session.** Real clicks
into the real window, warm page cache:

```
 202  AVAILABLE        6.1 ms          202  AVAILABLE       10.8 ms
 201  INSTALLED    1,584.4 ms   -->    201  INSTALLED        8.5 ms
 202  AVAILABLE        2.7 ms          202  AVAILABLE        5.3 ms
 201  INSTALLED    1,535.8 ms          201  INSTALLED        9.5 ms
```

99.8% of it was one call, re-derived on every switch: `why_incomplete` opens
every shard of every container and parses up to 4 MB of header out of each. It
is now remembered against the file's own length and modified time — a container
cannot gain the bytes it was missing without changing both — and the scan runs
on a worker.

**The icon was off centre, and by exactly the amount arithmetic predicted.**
`make-ico.py` centred with `(px - inner) // 2`, which floors, so an odd margin
put the whole mark one pixel left and one pixel high. Four of nine sizes: 16,
32, 40 and 64 — and 16 and 32 are the taskbar and notification-area sizes,
which is where it was noticed. Measured on the shipped file rather than on the
arithmetic: **4 of 9 frames exactly centred before, 8 of 9 after**. The ninth
is the mark's own geometry, not its placement.

**The bound alone would have hidden it.** The broken icon was also "centred to
within 1 px", so a pass/fail on that threshold said nothing whatever — which is
why `tools/check-logo-centred.py` reports the count of exactly-centred frames,
the number that actually moved.

**`--auto` now predicts, and the prediction is worth having.** On
Qwen3-30B-A3B it says *"about 1.42 tok/s — 1.02 GiB per token at 2.07 GiB/s"*
and the run measures **1.51**. Within 6%. It said 4.25 first, because a token's
expert slice was computed as the pool over the layer count — a plausible-looking
quantity that is 3x too small, and `ModelProfile::from_gguf` has had the right
arithmetic all along.

The read speed is never measured automatically: the benchmark writes a file
larger than RAM. `chaos-probe --bandwidth` writes what it measured to
`~/.chaos/bandwidth` and `--auto` reads it. With nothing there it states the
byte count, which is known, and names the command that supplies the rest —
**a guessed disk speed times a real byte count is a confident number with
nothing behind it**.

**The Android app is a client, and it has never been run.** `dl.google.com` —
the sole distributor of the Android SDK, build-tools and androidx — answers
**404 to every request from this network**, including a Go download that
certainly exists, from a server identifying itself as Google's own. So the APK
is built on GitHub's runners and the only check it has had is that build. It is
debug-signed, because an unsigned release APK cannot be installed and a
per-build key would stop Android upgrading in place.

`chaos-serve --host` opens the endpoint to the LAN, and **the api key stops
being optional the moment the socket leaves loopback** — a non-loopback bind
with no key refuses to start, before the model loads rather than four minutes
after.

**A full run-through, as a transcript rather than a memory.**
`scripts/run-through.ps1` presses every control on every page and reports what
blocked the UI thread: **22 exercised, 6 skipped by policy, worst call 36.9
ms**. DELETE, RESET and BROWSE are listed rather than pressed — a run-through
that deleted a model or wiped the settings would be a worse bug than anything
it could find. The INSTALLED/AVAILABLE crash Atur reported is **still not
reproduced**: 60 rapid switches, worst 28.9 ms, process alive and responding.

**Not done, and not quietly dropped**: a negative prompt (this pipeline's
guidance uses a separately trained unconditional twin fed no text, so it is a
real change to which weights run, and there is no quality harness to judge it);
image quality below 1024; Android Phase B; and `chaos-worker`. 20 tok/s on
V4-Flash stays excluded by Atur's own instruction and by measurement.

**Twelve of thirteen installed models generate correct text** on this 15.7 GiB
machine, checked by requiring `Paris` after "The capital of France is" rather
than by exit code — including gemma-3-27b at 15.41 GB, larger than the free
memory, correct at 0.05 tok/s, and **V4-Flash at 144 GB answering the same prompt
with `" Paris."`** — 0.42 tok/s prefill, 0.176 tok/s generation from `chaos-run`,
and 0.45 tok/s on a shorter prompt through `chaos-serve`. **The thirteenth,
Qwen3.6-27B-Q4_K_M, fails in llama.cpp too**: the two
engines agree to five significant figures on every layer sum and then both
overflow to NaN at `l_out-5`. Chaos warns before generating and points at the
container.

**The release**: v0.0.15, **published 2026-08-21**, **eight** assets across
**five** builds — Windows
installer and zip; Linux x86_64 tarball, `.deb` and AppImage; Linux **arm64**
tarball; macOS **arm64** and **x86_64** tarballs. The last two are new in
v0.0.12: `macos-latest` is Apple Silicon only, so an Intel Mac had nothing that
ran, and `ubuntu-latest` is x86_64 only, so a Pi or an Ampere box had nothing
either. The eight names were read back off the releases API after publishing
rather than predicted from the workflow.

**The Intel Mac build was written against a retired runner and caught by a dry
run, not by a release.** `macos-13` was retired on 2025-12-08, and a retired
label does not fail — it **queues**, against a pool with no runners, reporting
nothing. Had v0.0.12 been tagged on that matrix, `publish` (`needs: build`)
would have been skipped and the release page would have had **no assets at
all**. `macos-15-intel` is the current and last Intel image; Intel macOS ends
when it retires in autumn 2027.

**`chaos-draw` ships in v0.0.12.** It was an example, held back by a comment
saying it would become a binary "when there is evidence, not before". The
evidence: the autoencoder round-trips photographs at 36.09-40.89 dB with the
check ablated three ways, the text encoder answers `" Paris"` at logit 22.58,
the denoiser scores 0.85 velocity cosine against a real latent, and at 1024x1024
the output is photorealistic. **Object form is still imperfect** and `--help`
says so in the binary. All four models are in the catalogue, so `chaos-pull
ideogram-4 ideogram-4-uncond qwen3-vl-8b flux2-vae` fetches them. A release now
carries **twelve** binaries.

**The setup's UNINSTALL button removed an install on one click, with no
confirmation, and it took Atur's.** Fixed in v0.0.15: it names what goes, says
the models are kept and where, and offers "Press No if you meant to update
instead". It is also hidden when nothing is installed, and the installer can no
longer block forever waiting on a Chaos that is busy loading a model. **The
question that would have caught this -- what does this button do if pressed by
accident -- is cheap and was never asked.**

**Chaos runs in the background now.** Closing the window hides it to the
notification area and leaves the model loaded and the endpoint serving; the icon
says what is running, its menu has Open / Stop / Exit, and **Exit is the only
thing that stops the engine**. Verified on the built binary rather than by
reading the diff: `WM_CLOSE` leaves the process alive with the window hidden,
the tray Open command brings it back, and Exit ends the process. On Windows 11
the icon starts behind the `^` — that is where the shell puts every new one.

**Chaos updates itself now.** It asks GitHub once at startup whether a newer
release exists and says nothing unless one does; `Help ▸ Check for updates` asks
on demand, `Help ▸ Install update…` fetches the installer and hands over, and
`chaos-run --update` does the same from a terminal. One installer carries all
twelve binaries, so one update updates every export and leaves the models
directory alone. `CHAOS_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` turns the automatic check off. The
decision — is this newer, which asset does this platform need — is
`chaos_model::release`, tested against a fixture of **GitHub's real response**
rather than one this repo wrote: `0.0.9` must not look newer than `0.0.11`, and
the assets must not come back labelled with the uploader's name.

**Six defects Atur found by using the window, all fixed in v0.0.12.** The rail
lit every page at once (invalidating a parent does not repaint owner-drawn
children, so nothing ever un-lit the previous item); drop-downs opened exactly as
wide as their box, so *"Processor (the GPU is not used here yet)"* was
unreadable; BROWSE was drawn on top of the sentence explaining the models folder,
because two layout walkers stepped by different amounts; the mark in the rail was
44px with 16 levels of antialiasing against two dozen one-pixel rays; model names
were truncated from the wrong end; and the window opened off the corner of a
scaled display because the process claimed no DPI awareness at all.

**There is no v0.0.9.** The version was bumped in `Cargo.toml` and the installer
was exercised locally, but **the tag was never pushed**, so v0.0.8 stayed the
newest release and this file claimed a release that did not exist. Corrected on
2026-08-20; the tag list is the authority, not this paragraph. What *was* checked
locally at 0.0.9 still holds and shipped in 0.0.10: 28.2 MB carrying 11 binaries,
installed to a test prefix, the installed `chaos-run` generated *" Paris."*,
reinstall reported "Reinstalling Chaos", and uninstalling from inside the folder
removed the prefix, the registry key, the PATH entry and the staged helper —
leaving the models directory untouched.

**Chaos decodes images, and the autoencoder is verified rather than eyeballed**
(2026-08-19). `chaos-image` builds the FLUX.2 autoencoder as a ggml graph — both
halves, 248 tensors, no transposes. The decoder is what a diffusion pipeline
needs; the **encoder was written so the decoder could be checked without a
reference implementation**: encode a real photograph, decode the latent, compare.
**36.09, 36.29, 36.49 and 40.89 dB** on four 256x256 photographs.

That number is only worth printing because the check was ablated first. Against
the same input, a `group_norm` missing its per-channel scale scores **16.77**, a
symmetrically padded downsampler **14.60**, and a skipped mid-block attention
**31.93** — all three still produce a recognisable picture, and all three would
have passed "it looks right". Unreversed convolution kernels abort ggml outright.
The suite carries the round trip at 128x128 as two `#[ignore]`d tests that
**panic rather than skip** when the file is absent.

**The whole image pipeline now runs end to end** (2026-08-20): Qwen3-VL for the
text, both Ideogram 4 denoisers for the sampling, and the autoencoder for the
pixels. It produces a **coherent photographic image that follows the prompt's colour and
scene**: at 512x512 "a red apple on a white table, studio photograph" drew a red
mass on white surfaces beside a wooden shelf. **The object's form is wrong** — a
flat saturated region rather than an apple — and that is the open problem, with
resolution the first suspect: the model is trained at 1024 and up, and the same
code scores 0.79 at 256 against 0.85 at 512.

The denoiser is scored **without looking at a picture**: a rectified-flow model
at noise level `sigma` must predict `noise - latent`, and both terms are known
because the verified encoder supplies a real latent. Cosine against the truth is
**0.85 at 512x512**. Scoring against each half separately — "can it see the
noise" against "can it see the image" — is what found the two bugs below, and a
picture could not have told them apart.

**Two of them are in the reference implementation.** `stable-diffusion.cpp`
passes `1.f / 128.f` as an attention scale that is really an F16 overflow guard
which cancels out, and it never reads the autoencoder's own latent
normalisation (`bn.running_mean`, `bn.running_var`). Being faithful to a
reference and being right are not the same thing.

**The project is now called `chaos`.** Every crate, binary, environment variable
and document was renamed on 2026-08-16 — `bigtea-run` is `chaos-run`,
`BIGTEA_THREADS` is `CHAOS_THREADS`, and nothing carries the old name. The git
remote is deliberately unchanged; Atur renames the repository himself, at which
point the `repository`/`homepage` URLs and the CI badge start resolving.

**Current**: **928 tests** (0 failed, 42 ignored — the V4-Flash set
needs the container, and the autoencoder set needs the 336 MB `flux2-vae`;
measured 2026-08-28, and the ignored count was recorded as 33 while a run
reported 42),
clippy `--workspace --all-targets -D warnings` 0, fmt clean. **165 of llama.cpp's 182 long flags implemented, 17 declined with a
written reason, 0 unrecognised** — counted from both binaries rather than by
reading, which is the only way that number has ever been right.

## Seven reported problems, seven measured causes (2026-08-19)

Atur listed seven. Each turned out to have a cause that could be measured
rather than guessed at, and in three cases the cause was not what the symptom
pointed at.

**1. Loading a second model sent the messages to the first one.** The window
never stopped the running server, so the second `chaos-serve` died with
`os error 10048` while `/health` kept answering from the old one — and the
window called the new model ready. The orphan's handle was overwritten too, so
its memory was held until reboot. **This, not the GPU, is what "after one run
V4-Flash does not respond" was.** Reproduced both ways before the fix; A-then-B
on one port now reports B.

**2. The GPU was accepted and ignored on V4-Flash.** `--device` and `-ngl`
changed nothing and printed nothing, so "I turned the GPU on and it does no
work" described the program exactly. It says so now. Not built rather than not
wanted: the always-read set is 7.38 GiB against 5.11 GiB free on this card, and
the only measured streaming-MoE figure on it is **4.3x slower** than the host
path.

**3. Four of the app's settings did nothing.** `chaos-serve` swallowed every
flag it did not know, and it knew none of `-ngl`, `-c`, `--auto`, `--force`
while the app sent all four. An unknown flag is an error now — in
`chaos-serve`, `chaos-probe`, `chaos-pull` and `chaos-model-info`. `-c`,
`--force` and `--auto` work; `-ngl` is refused by name with the reason.

**4. The uninstall could not finish**, for three independent reasons: a modal
dialog outlived the staged helper's ten-second patience, `version.txt` was
never removed so the folder could never be deleted, and `UninstallString`
carried no arguments so Add/Remove Programs opened the *installer*. All three
fixed, and the whole flow run end to end — directory, registry key and PATH
entry all gone, with the helper reporting.

**5. An update looked like a first install.** The upgrade line was only ever
written into the report, after the install had run. The welcome screen now says
it before the button is pressed, and the button says UPDATE.

**6. Eight of ten binaries had no icon**, because `chaos-app` and `chaos-setup`
each held a private copy of the `windres` work and the other four crates had
nothing to include. One `chaos-build` crate now holds it; verified by
extracting the icon from all ten executables — one hash. And Explorer caches an
icon by path, so an upgrade kept showing the old one until the installer
started telling the shell otherwise.

**7. Mojo and `xtool`, answered from the sources.** Mojo is genuinely open
source (Apache 2.0, compiler included, CUDA/HIP/Metal) and is a language rather
than a memory manager — the residency policy it was hoped to provide is what
this project already *is*. What it could replace is ggml's kernels, and the
routed expert arithmetic is under 5% of a V4-Flash token. `xtool` builds *iOS*
apps with SwiftPM, so it is the wrong tool for a Rust project targeting macOS —
and the macOS build, the `.deb` and the AppImage already exist and shipped in
v0.0.8. Full reasoning:
[`research/mojo-and-macos-packaging-2026-08-19.md`](docs/graph/research/mojo-and-macos-packaging-2026-08-19.md).

**The logo's eyes are back.** An SVG path is one region however many subpaths it
has, so with the default nonzero winding a reversed subpath is a *hole* — and
one path in this mark is a near-white shape whose hole is what the eyes show
through. The generator filled each subpath independently and filled the hole
too. 43 paths producing 44 polygons was the tell.

**Slow but stable is the policy now — and the first sweep of it was wrong.**
Twelve installed models were run and all twelve exited 0, which was written down
as "twelve of twelve" before the outputs were read. **Qwen3.6-27B exits 0 and
prints `ทัน ทัน ทัน ทัน ทัน ทัน`.** That is this project's own documented
hazard — a wrong forward pass produces fluent nonsense, never a crash — walked
into by a test that checked exit codes. The claim is retracted; the sweep now
requires the word `Paris` in the continuation of "The capital of France is",
which is a correctness check rather than a liveness one.

Re-run that way, one prompt each, greedy, on this 15.7 GiB machine:

| model | on disk | tok/s | |
|---|---|---|---|
| Llama-3.2-1B | 0.75 GB | 19.52 | correct |
| Qwen3.5-0.8B | 0.76 GB | 14.24 | correct |
| gemma-3-4b | 2.32 GB | 7.09 | correct |
| Qwen3-4B | 2.33 GB | 7.41 | correct |
| Llama-3.2-3B | 1.88 GB | 7.01 | correct |
| Qwen2.5-Coder-7B | 4.36 GB | 2.51 | correct |
| Qwen3-8B | 4.68 GB | 4.39 | correct |
| gemma-3-12b | 6.80 GB | 2.96 | correct |
| phi-4 | 8.28 GB | 2.20 | correct |
| Qwen3-14B | 8.38 GB | 1.03 | correct |
| **gemma-3-27b** | **15.41 GB** | **0.05** | **correct** |
| **Qwen3.6-27B** | **15.66 GB** | 0.02 | **WRONG** |
| **V4-Flash** | **144 GB** | 0.176 | **correct** |

**Eleven of twelve correct — and the twelfth is not this engine's fault.**
The line worth keeping is gemma-3-27b: 15.41 GB of weights on a machine with
~7 GiB free, generating correct text at 0.05 tok/s. Nothing about that is fast
and nothing about it is refused, which is the order Atur asked for — make it
run, then make it quick. V4-Flash adds a thirteenth at 144 GB, answering through
the server at 0.45 tok/s.

**Qwen3.6-27B fails in llama.cpp too, and from identical numbers.** Same
container, same prompt, greedy: Chaos returns `ทัน ทัน ทัน`, llama.cpp returns
`333333`. Neither says Paris. The per-layer sums agree to five significant
figures through layer 5 — `l_out-0` 59.1449 against 59.1446, `attn_residual-5`
1009342 against 1009345 — and then **both** go NaN at `l_out-5`, where the
residual has climbed three orders of magnitude above layer 4's 128.

That agreement is a clue, not a defence. It says the port reproduces llama.cpp
faithfully including its behaviour here, which narrows where to look — and
reproducing a wrong answer precisely is still a wrong answer. **Chaos is judged on
whether it answers correctly, not on whether it matches somebody else.** Ruled out
by measurement: the
container is complete (851/851 tensors), no f32 weight holds a NaN (all 449
scanned), repacking, the key-head broadcast, the tokenizer, and every shape.
What is left is this Unsloth Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K quantisation, or how this
architecture is implemented at 64 blocks — and if it is the second, the fix comes
from Qwen's own model definition rather than from another engine's version of it.
`Qwen3.8-27B-UD-Q2_K_XL.gguf` at 9.94 GiB separates the two and is the model
wanted anyway; Qwen3.6 comes out once it generates correctly.
[`backlog/qwen35-27b-is-wrong.md`](docs/graph/backlog/qwen35-27b-is-wrong.md).

The failure is not "too big": gemma-3-27b is the same size and is right. It is
`qwen35` at 64 blocks.

`qwen35` is verified against llama.cpp **on Qwen3.5-0.8B**, byte-identical at
three prompt lengths. On Qwen3.6-27B it is not verified — and the measurement
below shows llama.cpp fails there too, from the same numbers, so what is
unverified is the container rather than the port. Ruled out by measurement:

- **The key-head broadcast.** The 27B has 16 key heads and 48 value heads where
  the 0.8B has 16 and 16, so a missing broadcast would be invisible at 0.8B and
  fatal at 27B. `gated_delta_net_and_the_key_head_broadcast` asks the fused op
  directly at a 2:6 ratio: narrow q/k and hand-repeated q/k agree, so the op
  broadcasts and the caller correctly does not. The test stays, because that was
  a comment asserting a behaviour nobody had checked.
- **Every tensor shape.** `attn_qkv` 10240 = `2*key_dim + value_dim`,
  `ssm_conv1d` 10240, `ssm_norm` 128 = `head_v_dim`, `attn_q` 12288 =
  `2 * head_count * key_length`, and 851 tensors = 48 recurrent + 16 attention
  blocks plus three. Every one scales exactly as `SsmConfig` computes it, and
  the first four blocks' tensor names are identical between the two containers.

Still open: repacking is the remaining structural difference — the 0.8B is Q8_0
and the 27B is a Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K mix — and `CHAOS_NO_REPACK=1` is the next
experiment. **`chaos-run` must warn, or refuse, on a `qwen35` container whose
shape is not the one that was diffed.** Ticket:
[`backlog/qwen35-27b-is-wrong.md`](docs/graph/backlog/qwen35-27b-is-wrong.md).

## Qwen3.8-27B is Qwen3.6's architecture, and the delta rule is one op (2026-08-19)

Atur asked for **Qwen3.8-27B instead of 3.6**. It is the same architecture, read
from the container rather than inferred:

```
gguf v3, 866 tensors, 51 metadata keys
architecture                  qwen35
tensor bytes          17,912,397,824      dense -- nothing streams
```

Upstream: `Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration`, `model_type qwen3_5`,
`image-text-to-text`, plus a separate 928 MB `mmproj`. **3.8 is 3.6's gated delta
net with a vision tower added** — strictly more work, not a way round it. Both
are now in the catalogue, and a test asserts they agree on the architecture so
this stops being true loudly rather than quietly. Note the fit too: 17.9 GB dense
against 15.7 GB of RAM, so even once it runs, Q4 does not fit this laptop and
`UD-Q2_K_XL` at 10.7 GB is the one that would.

**The open question is answered: `ggml_gated_delta_net` is the whole chunked
delta rule in one op, and it is in the archive this project already links.**
That is what turns "a research project" into "a port". Bound and tested this
session, with `ggml_ssm_conv`, `ggml_l2_norm`, `ggml_rope_multi` and the 4-D
view/reshape/cont/repeat helpers.

**Three numeric tests, not a compile check** — a wrong FFI declaration mis-reads
its arguments and returns confident numbers rather than failing to build.
`l2_norm` takes a row of four 2s to 0.5 (`rms_norm` would give 1.0); `ssm_conv`
sums its rolling window to 10 then 14; `gated_delta_net` returns
`S*H*T*N + S*S*H*N` finite values with the carried state moved off zero.

**Qwen3.5, Qwen3.6 and Qwen3.8 run.** `qwen35` is in
`VERIFIED_ARCHITECTURES`: all 24 layers of Qwen3.5-0.8B match
`llama-eval-callback` by value and by sum, and greedy output is byte-identical to
llama.cpp at 1-, 5- and 22-token prompts — both regimes of the fused delta rule,
with the debug dump **off**.

The bug that took the longest was a tensor read back that was never computed: the
attention gate is a *sibling* view of the `attn_q` matmul, so a graph rooted at
q, k and v never evaluated it and it returned scratch-arena leftovers. Turning
the debug dump on changed the leftovers and appeared to fix the model.
`qwen35moe` stays out — its routed path is untested. Detail:
[`backlog/qwen35-gated-delta-net.md`](docs/graph/backlog/qwen35-gated-delta-net.md).

**Image generation is untouched.** Ideogram 4 is listed and refused; nothing in
[`backlog/image-generation-ideogram-4.md`](docs/graph/backlog/image-generation-ideogram-4.md)
has been built.

## The window's three lies, found by using it (2026-08-19)

Atur listed six things in one message. Three were bugs in which the window said
something untrue, and each is now fixed with a test that would have caught it.

**1. Every settings dropdown was two pixels tall.** A Win32 combo box is sized
by the height of its *dropped list*, not of its closed box, and `layout` passed
it the row height. The options were always there — `CB_GETCOUNT` reported three
to six per control — and the list they opened into had no room. Measured with
`CB_GETDROPPEDCONTROLRECT` against the installed binaries: **32 px in v0.0.7,
238 px in v0.0.8**.

**2. `models folder` was written and never read.** The app saved it to
`settings.txt`; no code anywhere consulted it. `chaos_model::find` reads it now,
so `chaos-run` and `chaos-serve` honour it too, it takes several folders
separated by `;`, and each search folder's immediate subfolders are scanned.
That last part is why **DeepSeek-V4-Flash became visible without moving a byte**
— 145 GB in `C:\Projects\models\v4flash`, invisible to a top-level-only scan.

Verified end to end after the fix: `chaos-run v4flash "The capital of France
is"` → *" Paris."*, 5 prompt tokens in 8.5 s, **0.340 tok/s** generating, with a
9 GB download running against the same disk.

**3. A half-finished download looked finished.** Three models on Atur's machine
were truncated and all three were listed as ready. `Gguf::expected_file_bytes`
reads the container's own tensor index, so a short file is *provably* short —
no catalogue, no network. MODELS marks the row, LOAD refuses and names the
shortfall, DOWNLOAD becomes the resume button, and `chaos-run`/`chaos-serve`
refuse before binding anything.

**Every installed model was then run, through the installed v0.0.8 rather than
the build tree.** Ten of eleven generate correct text — Llama-3.2 1B/3B,
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B, Qwen3-4B, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, Gemma-3 4B/12B/27B, Phi-4 —
and V4-Flash generates. The eleventh, Qwen3.6-27B, is refused by architecture.

**v0.0.8 is released** with all six assets, and the published installer was
downloaded and run: 0.0.7 → 0.0.8 in place, 12 binaries, and the dropdowns on
the *installed* build measure 238 px.

### The two that are not fixed, and why

**Qwen3.5 / 3.6 / 3.8 is done** — see the section above. It needed a recurrent
memory rather than a rope fix, and `qwen35` is now in `VERIFIED_ARCHITECTURES`:
Qwen3.6-27B generates on this machine, slowly. `qwen35moe` is still out, because
no MoE container of the family has been run here.

**Ideogram 4 is open-weight and is an image model.** Listed in the catalogue,
sized from the repository, refused with the reason. One image needs four parts —
the denoiser, its unconditional twin, Qwen3-VL-8B as text encoder, and a VAE —
and Chaos has code for none of the last three, nor for conv2d, a sampler loop,
`.safetensors`, or PNG. The container proves the point: **458 tensors and zero
metadata keys**, so there is not even a `general.architecture` to dispatch on.
Two honest routes in
[`backlog/image-generation-ideogram-4.md`](docs/graph/backlog/image-generation-ideogram-4.md).

**One of the two is now closed, and the other is honestly named.** Qwen3.5/3.6/3.8
runs and is diffed against llama.cpp; Ideogram 4 is an image model needing four
components this engine has none of. **v0.0.11 is not called an LTS**, and the
reason is Ideogram plus the server's missing device loader: a release that calls
itself long-term-supported while a settings control it ships cannot do anything
is making a claim about the wrong thing. What v0.0.11 *is*: every control on
every page does what it says, or says why it cannot.

## A browser interface, and what a browser found (2026-08-17)

`chaos-serve` now serves a chat UI at `GET /`, compiled into the binary: no CDN,
no fonts, no build step, works with the network cable out. The transport is the
`/v1/chat/completions` SSE endpoint agents already use, so the page exercises the
same path a real client does rather than a second one written for it. **8 tests**
cover the ways a page breaks while still returning 200 — an outside fetch, an
unbalanced tag, an element the script reaches for that does not exist, non-ASCII
making `Content-Length` disagree with the body, `innerHTML` letting model output
inject markup.

**Pointing a browser at it found two bugs no agent would ever have hit.**

1. **An idle connection wedged the server, permanently.** Browsers open
   speculative TCP connections and leave them idle; the accept loop is
   single-threaded and blocked in `read_request` on a socket that would never
   send anything. No error, no log line, just a server that never answered
   again. Every client until now was an agent, and an agent connects in order to
   send immediately. A 3-second read deadline bounds it — at the 20 s first tried,
   a page behind one dead socket took **17.9 s** to load, which is a hang as far
   as anyone watching is concerned. Measured after: **1 ms clean, 1.9 s behind an
   idle connection**, against never.
2. **The headers went out with the source's indentation on them.** `send_html`
   was written with a wrapped string literal, so `Content-Type` carried nine
   leading spaces, curl folded it into the previous line, and the declared length
   (7658) disagreed with what a client actually read (7802). The SSE path
   directly below already carries a comment saying not to do this. Built by
   concatenation now, and declared length matches the body exactly.

Also: **`chaos-serve` with no argument serves the only model on the machine**,
which is what makes a double-click launcher possible — a shortcut cannot know the
name of a file the user has not put there yet. Two or more and it still lists
them and stops.

**A flaky test from #93 was removed.** `the_spill_rate_beats_the_load_rate_it_replaced`
asserted a strict inequality between two measured I/O rates; three consecutive
runs on an idle machine gave fail / pass / pass, and the failing pair was **1.44
against 1.49 GiB/s** — a 3% difference standing in for an effect of ~1.6x. It
could not have done its job either: a pool collapsed onto one handle measures
0.76x, inside the same noise, so no threshold separates "regressed" from
"unlucky". The plausibility bounds stay, the comparative claim lives in the
research node where it was measured under control.

**Current**: **738 tests**, 0 failed.

## The app has four pages and a menu (2026-08-18)

Atur's verdict on the 0.0.6 window: *"too messy and not user friendly … why is
all click in one slot … where is settings, where is model management, where is
the menu"*. He was right, and the reason was structural: **everything was on one
screen because the window had been grown one button at a time**, so a model
list, a download catalogue, four actions and three settings shared one 380px
column.

**It is now four pages** — CHAT, MODELS, MONITOR, SETTINGS — reachable from a
navigation rail, a menu bar, or `Ctrl+1`..`Ctrl+4`, with a strip on every page
saying what is running, at what endpoint, and how fast. MODELS gives each model
its own page: status, endpoint, context, threads, cache, uptime, tokens served.
SETTINGS exposes all nine fields the file holds; the old window showed three.

The design follows Hermes' own `apps/desktop/DESIGN.md`, which Atur asked it to
match, with his `#0000F2` in place of Hermes' `#0053FD`. Two new modules carry
what the window used to hardcode: `theme.rs` (the palette, light and dark) and
`nav.rs` (which page owns which control). Both are plain data and testable
without a window server, which is where this crate's bugs have always been.

**Two rules are now enforced at the source level**, because neither is
observable at runtime: no Win32 call while the state is mutably borrowed (a
`RefCell` double borrow under `panic = "abort"` is silent process death), and no
colour named outside `theme.rs`. Contrast is asserted numerically — every
text-on-ground pair clears 4.5:1 in both palettes.

**Verified by screenshot, not by building.** Every page captured, pixels
sampled (`#F5F5FC` chrome, `#E7E7FE` accent wash), a model loaded and a
conversation generated at 15.4 tok/s through the new shell.

**Measured negative**: the menu bar cannot be darkened. `SetPreferredAppMode`
(uxtheme ordinal 135) resolves and runs on 10.0.26200 and changes nothing,
before or after window creation; the code was removed rather than shipped as a
no-op. Scrollbars *are* fixable and were — `#F0F0F0` to `#171717`.

**Still missing**: MONITOR cannot show streamed bytes, expert read rate or cache
residency. The engine measures all three and prints them to its log; nothing
carries them over the socket. The page says so on its face.

**Current**: **738 tests**, 0 failed.

## v0.0.6 — the app actually works now (2026-08-18)

**0.0.5's app could not be used.** Clicking INSTALLED or AVAILABLE killed the
process instantly: `WM_CTLCOLORLISTBOX` borrows the window state, and the list
fill held a mutable borrow across `SendMessageW`, which dispatches that message
synchronously. A `RefCell` double borrow, and `panic = "abort"` makes that
immediate process death with no window, no message and no log.

**Six sites had that shape. Three were found by a test, not by clicking** — one
of them `unload_model`, the button that frees the model's memory. The test is a
*source* check (`crates/chaos-app/tests/ui_rules.rs`), because the failure is an
abort that no harness can observe at runtime.

Also fixed: the GUI uninstall removed nothing (it stayed open, so the staged
helper could not delete the directory the window ran from), and closing the
window left `chaos-serve` alive holding every resident byte.

**Shipped alongside**: nine icon sizes rendered from the SVG and compiled in
with `windres`; the endpoint URL shown so an agent can be pointed at it; DELETE
that removes every shard; live memory; settings persisted outside the install
with unknown keys preserved; a sidebar that scales so the fit verdict is
readable; install and uninstall reports; `docs/APP.md`.

**CI now starts the app**, waits, and fails if it exited or wrote a crash log —
and checks no `chaos-serve` survives it. An app that only *builds* is exactly
what shipped 0.0.5.

**Still open**: SmartScreen (a certificate, not a patch), uninstall verified via
`/S` rather than the Settings UI, and no per-model window — one model at a time.
`docs/graph/backlog/app-to-production.md` tracks them.

## An installer, an app, and 13 models to fetch (2026-08-18)

**`chaos-setup.exe` carries the whole project inside one file** -- 23.6 MB, 16
files embedded at link time by `build.rs` from a staging directory. No archive
to unpack, no PowerShell, no toolchain, no network, no administrator rights.
Built without NSIS, WiX, Inno or MSI tooling, because every one of those would
have to be installed on the build machine before a release could be cut, and a
Windows install turns out to be a window, a file copy, a PATH entry, a shortcut
and one registry key.

Verified by running it, not by reading it: install writes 17 files, the
**installed** `chaos-run` reports `0.0.3`, it registers in Add/Remove Programs,
and uninstall removes bin, the PATH entry and the registry key. **The models
directory survives**, because it lives outside the prefix on purpose -- a test
pins that, since the alternative is deleting someone's 155 GB download.

Silent mode (`/S`, `/S --uninstall`, `--prefix`) exists because a
windows-subsystem binary has no console and CI has nobody to press a button.
`release.yml` now stages the binaries, builds the installer, **checks it is not
smaller than half its own payload** (an installer that embedded nothing still
builds, still runs, and installs zero files), runs install/run/uninstall, and
attaches `Chaos-<version>-Setup.exe` as its own asset beside the archive.

**The catalogue went from 2 models to 13.** Every repo, filename stem and byte
count was read from the Hugging Face tree API and verified to resolve before it
was added -- a wrong stem is a download button that 404s, and this project's own
rule is that nothing is citable until it has been run. All the new entries use
architectures in `VERIFIED_ARCHITECTURES`: Qwen3 4B/8B/14B/32B, Gemma-3
4B/12B/27B, Llama-3.2 1B/3B, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B, Phi-4.

**Every dense entry sets `always_read_bytes` equal to `bytes`**, and ten tests
enforce it. That is not padding: a dense container has no routed experts, so
nothing streams and the whole file must fit. It is what makes the app say
`qwen3-32b 19.8 GB needs 19.8 GB - too big` honestly on this laptop, while
`v4flash 155 GB needs 7.92 GB - streams`.

**738 tests** (was 706), clippy 0, fmt clean.

## 20 tok/s on V4-Flash is closed, with a number (2026-08-16)

Full node:
[`research/v4flash-ram-frontier-2026-08-16.md`](docs/graph/research/v4flash-ram-frontier-2026-08-16.md).

**With every expert resident — infinite RAM, zero disk — this engine tops out at
1.19 tok/s on this CPU.** A generated token is **1.56 s of expert slice reading
(3.15 GiB at 2.02 GiB/s) plus 0.84 s that never touches the disk**. 20 tok/s is a
50 ms token, so the disk-independent cost alone is **17x over budget**, and no
amount of memory touches it.

**The frontier was swept by removing memory rather than adding it** — a balloon
process commits and touches N GiB, and Chaos sizes its resident block from the
free RAM it sees. Four points, three interleaved passes:

| balloon | resident GiB | spill GiB | median tok/s | spread |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 | 7.38 | 0.00 | **0.411** | 1.9% |
| 2 | 6.16 | 1.22 | 0.352 | 4.8% |
| 4 | 4.09 | 3.28 | 0.278 | 3.2% |
| 6 | 2.04 | 5.33 | 0.221 | 2.7% |

`t = 0.395 s/GiB × spill + 2.353 s`, **R² = 0.997**. Spilled weights are re-read
at 2.53 GiB/s — near the 2.74 GiB/s drive ceiling, because a per-block prefetch
is a friendlier pattern than the scattered six-slice expert gather. And memory
pressure slows the expert read itself (1.65 vs 2.02 GiB/s), so a shortfall costs
more than its own re-read.

**Extrapolated, this is a purchasing table**: 16 GB → 0.42 (measured), 64 GB →
0.55, 128 GB → 0.93, 160 GB → **1.19**. Holding the entire 144 GB model in RAM is
worth **2.9x, not 48x**.

**F was attacked before being trusted.** A `-t` 2/4/8/16 sweep gives block work
0.92 / **0.78** / 0.95 / 1.27 s, so 0.84 s is a floor on this CPU rather than a
knob left in the wrong position; the expert read is flat at 1.54-1.55 s
throughout, because it is the drive. 20 tok/s separately needs **67.7 GB/s** to
the expert weights, at or past dual-channel DDR5 — so it is a GPU-memory
specification. **Flagged as arithmetic, not measurement**: resident-in-VRAM is
untested here and the only measured GPU figure is 4.3x *slower* on streaming MoE.
Do not quote a GPU V4-Flash number until someone runs one.

## The shortfall warning was 1.5x pessimistic, and now it is measured (2026-08-17)

`chaos-run` tells a user how much of the always-read set will be re-read on every
token, what that costs, and which processes to close. **The cost was computed
from the rate the initial *load* achieved, and overstated it by about 1.5x** —
the load is essentially one stream at 1.6-2.0 GB/s, while the spill comes back
across the eight-handle reader pool. The line matters because the next one is
*"closing these would free up to N GiB"*, so an inflated cost oversells closing an
editor. Full write-up:
[`research/spill-cost-is-measured-2026-08-17.md`](docs/graph/research/spill-cost-is-measured-2026-08-17.md).

**The true marginal cost is 0.41 ± 0.01 s/GiB, from three independent balloon
sweeps** — `0.395*spill + 2.353` (2026-08-16, by hand), `0.418*spill + 2.394`,
and `0.410*spill + 2.204` at R² = 0.997, the last two this session at 4 balloon
sizes x 3 interleaved passes. Only the slope is claimed; the intercepts move with
free RAM. The sweep is now `scripts/spill-sweep.sh` + `scripts/ram-balloon.ps1`,
because the first one was done by hand and could not be re-run.

**It is not fixed by hardcoding 0.395** — that is one drive on one machine.
`chaos_model::measure_spill_rate` re-reads a 256 MiB sample **of the spilled
tensors themselves**, through the same pool at the same alignment, and times it:
~0.1 s, only when there is a shortfall, `None` rather than a guess when the spill
is too small to sample.

| spill | old, from load rate | **new, measured** | swept truth |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1.54 GiB | 0.97 s (1.54x) | **0.7 s (1.11x)** | 0.63 s |
| 3.05 | 2.00 (1.60x) | **1.4 (1.12x)** | 1.25 |
| 4.57 | 2.78 (1.49x) | **1.7 (0.91x)** | 1.87 |
| 6.07 | 3.43 (1.38x) | **2.3 (0.92x)** | 2.49 |

**A consistent 1.5x overestimate becomes a mean of 1.02x**, with the scatter now
falling on both sides. The case in the original report — 1.53 GiB printed as
`~1.1s` — now prints `~0.7s` against a swept 0.63.

**Two negatives are worth more than the fix.** (1) **The obvious instrument is
wrong**: accumulating bytes and elapsed time inside `prefetch_dense_via` reads
**0.80 GiB/s**, a *3x* overestimate, because R2 overlap runs that prefetch on 2 of
8 handles for the duration of a block — its wall clock is occupancy, not cost.
`CHAOS_PREFETCH_OVERLAP=0` on the same binary reads 1.99. Built, measured,
reverted. (2) **The buffer allocation costs nothing measurable** (1.87 vs 1.86,
2.52 vs 2.52), so a two-ended range was dropped before it shipped. A first
version capping each read at 16 MiB swung 1.54-2.65 GiB/s because the cap changed
the read size; reading whole tensors, as the prefetch does, gives 2.10-2.80 with
a mean 2% off the swept rate.

Still open: **`chaos-serve` never prints a shortfall warning at all**, though it
loads a resident set the same way.

## CLAUDE.md pruned, and the test count was stale (2026-08-16)

`CLAUDE.md` had reached **3,308 words against its own stated ~2000-token
budget** — a rule the file itself carries and nobody had enforced. Its 35
long-form facts moved verbatim to
[`docs/graph/reference/hard-won-facts.md`](docs/graph/reference/hard-won-facts.md)
(38 entries, grouped), and `CLAUDE.md` now carries one summary line each and
points there. **1,238 words, ~1,700 tokens.** Nothing was dropped; the summaries
are lossy on purpose and the node says so.

**One entry was partly wrong and the move surfaced it.** *"Past ~6 GiB the expert
cache is the slowest configuration measured"* is a V4-Flash observation that had
been generalised: on Qwen3-30B a 2/4/6/8 GiB sweep gives 2.22/2.66/3.45/3.43
tok/s, which **plateaus rather than declining**
(`research/expert-read-overlap-does-not-pay-2026-08-16.md` recorded the
contradiction at the time and `CLAUDE.md` was never corrected). The headline —
hit rate is not a success metric — and the mechanism both stand. Retraction
noted in the node under the original entry rather than by editing it away.

**The README progress bars were redrawn.** They were ~100 characters wide with
wrapped continuation lines, so a GitHub code block reflowed them into a mess, and
an empty `[    ]` at 2% read as a rendering fault rather than a value. Now every
row is one line, ≤72 characters, brackets aligned, unfilled cells drawn as a
track rather than whitespace, and the prose that was wrapping sits below the
block. **The fill is floored, never rounded** — `Architectures` had been drawn
with 2 of 20 cells for 9.2%, which rounds up; it is 1. Checked by arithmetic
rather than by eye.

**The test count in this file was stale: 566 → 570.** The four `find.rs` lookup
tests landed after the from-zero run that produced 566, and the README badge
carried the same number. Counted from a clean full run: **50 binaries, 570
passed, 0 failed, 31 ignored.** Also a method note worth keeping — an earlier
count in the same session read 374, because the command piped `cargo test`
through `tail -40` and there were 50 result lines. **A filter that truncates
looks exactly like a regression**, and the only thing that caught it was the
number disagreeing with a previously measured one.

## The parity scoreboard, re-scored under the discriminator (2026-08-15)

**All thirteen dense architectures re-swept**, eight prompts each, against
`llama-completion` at `--temp 0`, with the harness that separates *"the
reference wobbles"* from *"our answer is a third one"*:

| | prompts |
|---|---:|
| **exact** — byte-identical to llama.cpp's default | **102** |
| **near-tie** — byte-identical to one of llama.cpp's *own* no-op outputs | **2** |
| **outside the band** — a third answer | **0** |
| **FAIL** | **0** |

**13 of 13 models exit 0.** The two near-ties are both Phi-3, and one of them
reproduces llama.cpp's `-b 1 -fa off` output — a **composed** configuration that
neither flag alone accounts for, which is exactly the class the r14 session
identified and the single-flag probe could not see.

`qwen3moe` is the fourteenth and is **not** in that table: 2 exact, 4 near-tie,
2 outside. It stays off `VERIFIED_ARCHITECTURES`. What changed is the size of the
question — the evidence for a defect there is **2 of 8, not the 6 of 8** that two
sessions independently reported, because four of those six reproduce llama.cpp's
own output byte for byte. See the discriminator section below.

**What this is not.** It is evidence about *these eight prompts* on *these
thirteen models*. `starcoder2` once passed 3/3 while running the wrong
pre-tokenizer, and V4-Flash is not swept here at all.

*(Counts in this section are what was true on 2026-08-15. The header at the top
of this file is the one to read; every dated section below is left alone on
purpose, so a number can be traced to the day it was taken.)*

**`VERIFIED_ARCHITECTURES` is thirteen** — `baichuan`, `internlm2` and `olmo`
added on `ticket/r14-architectures`, each diffed at **eight** prompts. Widening
the harness from three prompts to eight **found three bugs in code that had been
on `main` for weeks**, two of them inside entries already listed as verified:
Llama-3.1/3.2/3.3 rotated with the wrong RoPE (`rope_freqs.weight` was never
read), Falcon3 was prefilled one token short (no BOS, no `add_bos_token`), and a
USER_DEFINED token's raw `\n` was silently dropped by the byte decoder. Twelve
models re-run, **eleven at 8/8** (Phi-3 6 ok + 2 reference-unstable), 426 tests.
The rule those bugs cost: **"the reference disagrees with itself" is not a safe
verdict** — it compares the reference to itself and cannot see that *our input*
differed, and nine of eleven `unstable` verdicts this session were bugs. The
harness acted on it in `b2ad35f`: a mismatch now compares the **tokenized
prompt** first and reports FAIL on a different count, which catches all three of
those bugs in one test, and three near-ties in eight exits non-zero as a cluster.
**All twelve models were re-swept under the stricter script with every result
unchanged**, every model exiting 0. Details:
`research/eight-prompts-found-three-bugs-2026-08-11.md`.

**Everything is merged.** PR #55 brought R3, R7, R8 and R9 into `main` in one
merge — the KV cache, six architectures, four tokenizer families, 106 CLI flags,
weight repacking, the thread work and the first quality measurement this project
has had. #44, #56 and #57 closed with it; their branches are deleted.

*(Both landed. GBNF/JSON-schema constrained decoding is `chaos-grammar`; R2's
overlap was measured at 1.03x on the Qwen3 path and reverted, and shown to be
unreachable on the V4-Flash path for a different reason — see the 2026-08-16
sections.)*

## In one paragraph

Chaos is a Rust inference runner for models that do **not** fit in memory. It
keeps the always-read weights resident and streams routed experts from disk per
token, borrowing `ggml` for arithmetic while owning memory, residency, streaming
and the token loop. It runs DeepSeek-V4-Flash (144 GB) and Qwen3-30B-A3B on a
15.7 GiB laptop and produces correct text. **It is not yet faster than
llama.cpp on V4-Flash — on that model it leads on nothing.**

## Where we actually stand, measured 2026-08-11 in one session

**Speed is level. Coverage is not.** Both halves matter and they have different
answers, so they are stated separately.

### Speed — parity on every model measured today

Interleaved runs, same session, `--temp 0`, 401-token prompt for the dense
models. **Absolute tok/s drifts up to 25% with machine state, so only
within-session comparisons are quoted**, and each number below is a median of
the rounds actually run.

| model | phase | Chaos | llama.cpp | verdict |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| Qwen3-4B (dense, fits RAM) | prefill | **76.5** | 69.3 | parity → ahead |
| Qwen3-4B | generation | **5.97** | 5.54 | **1.08x ahead** |
| Gemma-2-2B | prefill | 124 / 141 | 115 / 146 | parity |
| Gemma-2-2B | generation | 8.01 / 10.78 | 7.12 / 10.67 | parity → ahead |
| Qwen3-30B-A3B (streams from disk) | prefill | 1.70 | 1.77 | parity |
| Qwen3-30B-A3B | generation | 3.10 | 3.25 | parity (5% behind, inside the spread) |

**Three rows in the old scoreboard are now retracted as stale**, and all three
were deficits:

- Qwen3-4B "prefill 38.5 vs 111.2, **2.9x behind**" — now 76.5 vs 69.3.
- Qwen3-4B "generation 0.67 vs 5.90, **8.8x behind**" — now 5.97 vs 5.54.
- Qwen3-30B "generation 2.63 vs 4.21, **1.60x behind**" — now 3.10 vs 3.25,
  i.e. inside the noise. **The 4.21 was llama.cpp on a better day**: measured
  back to back today it runs 2.93–3.60 on the same command line, which is the
  clearest possible demonstration of why cross-session numbers are worthless.

**On the streaming model, run order dominates the result.** Whichever engine
runs second is slower — Chaos 3.92 running first against llama.cpp 3.60, and
2.71 running second against 2.93. A warm-to-warm protocol (each engine twice,
compare the seconds) is the only one that says anything, and it says parity.

**Nothing here is a claim about V4-Flash**, which was last measured 2026-08-10
and is unchanged: prefill 1.25x behind, generation at parity. See below.

### Coverage — this is the real gap

| | Chaos | llama.cpp | gap |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| architectures **diffed against the reference** | **13** | 141 declared | the big one |
| chat templates | 26 | 54 | half |
| CLI flags (long) | 119 | 182 | 63 |
| tokenizer families | 4 | 6 | rwkv, plamo2 |
| samplers | 16 | 20 | adaptive-p, infill, 2 lazy-grammar |
| GPU backends | **1** (Vulkan, *not verified*) | CUDA, Metal, Vulkan, SYCL, HIP | 4 |

The architecture number is not comparable as written: llama.cpp *declares* 141
and Chaos's 8 are ones whose output was diffed token for token against it.
Nobody has checked all 141. But 8 is still 8.

**The honest one-line answer: on this machine, for CPU inference on the models
we support, Chaos is as fast as llama.cpp. It supports far less.**

## The honest scoreboard

Never quote a comparison without the model name and the phase.

> **SUPERSEDED for both models — see the 2026-08-16 sections.** V4-Flash is
> **parity on prefill and generation** (1640 vs 1679 ms/prompt token, 0.394 vs
> 0.39 tok/s), and Qwen3-30B generation is **parity**, not the 1.60x deficit
> below. The table is left in place because the numbers below are what was true
> on their date and the corrections are the record.

**All V4-Flash rows below were measured back to back on 2026-08-10** with 9.3 GiB
free, which is the first time the whole 7.38 GiB always-read set fitted.

| model | phase | Chaos | llama.cpp | verdict |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| **V4-Flash** | prefill | 2060 ms/tok | **1644 ms/tok** | **1.25x behind** |
| **V4-Flash** | generation, 9 tok | 0.344 tok/s | **0.39** | 1.13x behind |
| **V4-Flash** | generation, 23 tok | 0.363 tok/s | — | cache still warming |
| **V4-Flash** | generation, 47 tok | **0.374 tok/s** | **0.39** | **96% — parity** |
| Qwen3-30B-A3B | prefill @565 | **27.6** | 23.6 | ahead |
| Qwen3-30B-A3B | prefill @2206 | **36.6** | 33.6 | ahead |
| Qwen3-30B-A3B | generation | **2.63** | **4.21 ± 0.28** | **1.60x behind** |

**The Qwen3-30B generation row moved twice on 2026-08-10 and both corrections
matter.** Chaos went 1.07 → **2.63** (2.46x) purely from the thread tuner
choosing **one** thread for the expert matmuls. And the llama.cpp reference is
**4.21 ± 0.28** at its own best (`-t 4`), not the 2.16 previously recorded — so
this is still a **deficit**, and a re-measured one, not a win.

**V4-Flash generation went 0.064 → 0.374 tok/s in one day — 5.8x** — and the
deficit against llama.cpp went from 3-4x to **4%**. It is parity, not a win, and
must not be quoted as one.

The trend is the interesting part: 0.344 at 9 tokens, 0.363 at 23, 0.374 at 47,
with the expert cache's hit rate climbing 9.7% → 20.2% → 23.5% as it warms.
llama.cpp is flat because it has nothing that warms. **Longer answers should
favour Chaos**, and that is measurable but not yet measured past 47 tokens.

Sources, with both command lines and outputs:
`docs/graph/research/v4flash-vs-llamacpp-2026-08-07.md` and
`head-to-head-llamacpp-2026-08-05.md`.

**Two claims are retracted and must never be repeated**: that Chaos leads
llama.cpp on V4-Flash load/prefill, and that llama.cpp cannot run models larger
than RAM. It runs the 144 GB model with `--no-repack`. "Larger than RAM" is not
the differentiator; **tok/s at a stated footprint under an owned residency
policy** is.

## What is done

- **v0.0.2 public**, Apache-2.0, CI green on Linux/macOS/Windows. 168 unit +
  16 container-backed tests. `clippy -D warnings` and `fmt` enforced.
- **V4-Flash port complete and verified** against llama.cpp element-sums: all 43
  blocks, all three attention builders, both routing schemes.
- **Prefill 2.2x faster** than Chaos's own previous version (32.4s → 10.1s at 5
  tokens), via skewed direct reads, batched expert reads and 24→6 graph
  evaluations per block.
- **R0 answered** (2026-08-08): the router is genuinely skewed, but **the hot
  expert set is per-prompt and cannot be pinned**. It corrected four v0.0.2
  numbers and killed the model-pruning plan. PR #43.
- **R0.1 answered** (2026-08-08): **a set warmed on the prompt covers ~86% of
  what generation goes on to need** (86.3% on a code prompt, 85.9% on a prose
  one) — within ~4 points of an oracle and ~32 above the cross-prompt figure.
  This is what makes R1 worth building. **Over a longer horizon the cache must
  keep warming**: with the same prompt, frozen coverage falls 86.3% → 68.8% as
  generation goes 15 → 46 tokens, and warming recovers it to 75.8%. R0.1's
  "fill it and leave it" is withdrawn — it held only for the first ~20 tokens.
- **R1 built** (2026-08-08): frequency-gated expert cache wired into the
  deepseek4 path, sized from the probe, hit rate reported with footprint and
  tok/s. **But it cannot pay until R3 exists** — see the ordering note below.

## What is left, in the order the measurements justify

| id | work | state | why it is next |
|---|---|---|---|
| **R3** | KV cache | **working, verified** — `ticket/r3-kv-cache`, fully scoped in `backlog/r3-kv-cache.md` | the unlock for everything else, not just a speed win. ~24 MB of state across **three** structures (the compressor ring is the one that is easy to miss). Verified without a new oracle: `prefill(0..n) then step(n)` must match `prefill(0..=n)` — argmax and a tolerance, **not** bit-identical, since routing already flips ~3% on near ties at a ggml blocking boundary. Test at 2, 5 and 165 tokens because each runs a different attention builder. Worth **~0.33 tok/s** from the measured 3.0s single-token pass alone, against llama.cpp's 0.21–0.31, and it is what makes R1 pay |
| **R1** | frequency-gated expert cache on the deepseek4 path | **built 2026-08-08, inert until R3** | implemented, tested against the oracle, sized from the probe, `--cache <GiB>` now works on this path. Warms on the prompt, never pinned. Cannot pay while a pass still reads ~123 distinct experts per layer |
| **R2** | overlap I/O with compute | ready, but smaller than it looks | per block it is ~53 ms read against ~23 ms compute, so the ceiling is ~1.4x — and all three expert tensors already read in one batched call, with everything after depending on them. Scoped against the code in the handoff |
| **R4** | fit the always-read set | user-side | 7.38 GiB; needs ~10.5 GiB free. Worth 0.7s/token. The runner already names the processes to close |
| **R5** | the product | **started** | `chaos pull`, quant selection from the probe, self-configuration, **OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions`**, prebuilt binaries |
| **R6** | run well on any machine | not started | one binary that reads the probe, configures itself, and says what tok/s to expect *before* doing anything |

**The order is not a preference, it is a dependency.** Expert reads are
deduplicated per block across the batch, so a pass reads the *distinct* experts
its tokens select. Measured on real prompts:

| tokens in the pass | distinct experts/layer | read per pass |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 (needs a KV cache) | 6 | **3.2 GiB** |
| 17 | 39.7 | 21 GiB |
| 166 | 122.8 | 66 GiB |

A cache of a few GiB cannot touch 66 GiB. Only once a step needs **6 experts per
layer** is the working set cacheable, and that is exactly what the KV cache buys.
So **R3 → R1 → R2**.

Detail for each: `docs/graph/backlog/next-session-handoff.md`.
Strategy and the bets beyond R6: `docs/graph/backlog/the-big-bang.md`.

## R3 — the KV cache works

**Generation no longer re-runs the sequence.** `chaos-run` keeps one cache for
the session: the prompt fills it, each token appends a single row.

```
generate 5 tokens   0.145 tok/s   (6.9 s/token)     was 0.064
```

**2.3x, and measured under memory pressure** — 5.7 GiB free at the time, so only
3.42 of the 7.38 GiB always-read set was resident and 3.95 GiB was re-read on
every token. A single-token pass with the whole set resident measured **3.0s**
(2026-08-08), which is ~0.33 tok/s; that figure has **not** been re-measured
since the cache landed and should not be quoted as achieved.

llama.cpp on the same model is 0.21–0.31 tok/s. **We are not yet past it on a
measurement taken under equal conditions.** The next honest comparison needs
~10.5 GiB free on both sides.

### What it took, and two bugs that would have shipped silently

Both were caught by the equivalence harness (`prefill(0..n)` + `step(n)` must
match `prefill(0..=n)`), not by reading the code:

1. **The compressor ring.** `compressor` front-padded `state_rows` zeros where
   llama.cpp keeps a ring — exact on a prefill, where the previous window is in
   the batch, and a lie on a step. It now slides on *every* pass through a
   compressed layer, including the three in four that complete no block.
2. **`fired` was relative.** It asked `nt / ratio > 0`, which is zero for any
   single-token step, so a step built no summary *and* told `attention` there was
   no compressed half at all — discarding everything the sequence had compressed.
   Now absolute: `(pos0 + nt) / r > pos0 / r`. **This one measured 15.05% wrong
   with the argmax still agreeing**, which is exactly the failure mode that reads
   as fluent nonsense. After the fix: 0.090%.

Equivalence now holds on both paths — raw 0.278% apart, compressed 0.090%, argmax
equal on both, with the residual proven to be a near-tie re-route rather than a
cache fault (hash-routed layers, which cannot depend on batch shape, agree
exactly).

**Still open**: the 256-token ceiling (#46) needs the ring wraparound.

## R1 re-measured (#47): the cache pays, once residency is satisfied first

With the always-read set fully resident, the expert cache stops competing and
starts helping:

| run | cache | hits | generation |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 9 tokens | off | — | 0.310 tok/s |
| 9 tokens | 1.0 GiB | 9.7% | **0.344** |
| 23 tokens | 1.5 GiB | 20.2% | **0.363** |
| 47 tokens | 1.5 GiB | 23.5% | **0.374** |

Earlier, under memory pressure, the same cache *hurt*: a byte given to it came
out of residency, where it would have been read on every token. `chaos-run`
refuses a cache while the always-read set is still streaming, and that rule is
now confirmed from both sides — it hurt at 2.43 GiB resident, it helps at 7.38.

**R0.1's ~86% is not reached, and 23.5% is not evidence against it**: that
figure is coverage of a prompt-warmed *set*, this is hit rate against a 1.5 GiB
budget holding ~1% of the model's experts. The measurement that tests R0.1
needs a much larger cache than this machine has spare.

## The byte budget, and why 20 tok/s is not a code problem (2026-08-10)

Generation reads **3.21 GiB per token**. 20 tok/s at the measured 1.58 GiB/s
direct-read rate allows **79 MB**. The gap is **42x**, and this session went
looking for it in the two places nobody had measured.

**Both were negative.** Full detail and controls:
`docs/graph/research/v4flash-has-no-slack-2026-08-10.md`.

| lever | worth | status |
|---|---:|---|
| expert-bank factorisation | 1.0x | **dead — measured, 1.2x from random noise** |
| drop the router's tail | ~1.2x | **costs 8.8% of routing mass — measured** |
| contextual sparsity | 1.1x | dead — experts are 9.1% negligible |
| pinned hot set | 1.0x | dead — R0, 37.5% vs 25.0% random |
| speculative decoding | 1.4x | real, but the docs' **2.2x does not transfer** |
| 4.25 → 2.5-bit experts | 1.7x | unproven on an MoE this size, quality-risky |
| warmed expert cache | 1.3x | measured at 23.5% hits with ~6 GiB spare |

Everything still alive, multiplied, is **3.1x**.

Three findings, all first measurements:

1. **The expert bank is full-rank.** `chaos-spectrum` (new) asked whether all
   256 experts in a layer share a subspace — if they did, one resident basis plus
   small per-expert coefficients would cut bytes by `4096/r` *and* cut flops. A
   rank-512 basis holds **20.4%** of the bank's energy against **16.6%** for
   matched random noise. 1.23x from nothing, confirmed on two layers and two
   projections, and converged (10 power iterations move rank-256 from 11.4% to
   11.5%).
2. **The router's tail is not small.** Renormalised weights, sorted, mean over 43
   layers: **33.5 / 20.6 / 15.0 / 12.1 / 10.1 / 8.8%**. Uniform would be 16.7%.
   The standing assumption that "the 6th expert contributes little" is false —
   reading three instead of six buys 2x and discards **31%** of the routing mass.
3. **Speculative decoding is ~1.4x here, not 2.2x.** The literature's figure
   assumes the verify pass costs what a single-token pass costs. Here it costs
   more, because more tokens select more distinct experts (`U(n) ≈ 6·n^0.667`,
   from this project's own dedup measurements). Below α≈0.75 it is a net *loss*.

Together with the earlier 9.1%-negligible result that is four independent probes
and four negatives, which says something about the model rather than the runner:
**V4-Flash has no redundancy left to harvest.** Its experts are mutually
distinct, internally dense, and its router spreads real weight across all six.
The 6-of-256 is the whole of this architecture's sparsity and Chaos already
exploits it.

**So 3.21 GiB/token is what this model costs, not an artefact.** 20 tok/s does
not need a better runner; it needs the active weights to stop coming from disk.
That makes the next question a measurable one nobody has published: **what is
the tok/s-versus-RAM frontier for a 144 GB model?** Chaos can sweep it because
it owns residency; an `mmap` engine cannot be told to use exactly N GiB.

## The plateau was ours, not the drive's (2026-08-10) — 1.32x on expert reads

Two written-down "facts" were ceilings we had built. Full detail and both new
tools: `docs/graph/research/the-plateau-was-ours-2026-08-10.md`.

**Where a token actually goes**, measured with `CHAOS_BLOCK_TIMING=1`:

| phase | before | share |
|---|---:|---:|
| dense always-read re-reads (disk) | 2.15 s | 39% |
| expert slice reads (disk) | 2.03 s | 37% |
| tail + graph overhead | 1.10 s | 20% |
| **expert matmul** | **0.18 s** | **3%** |

**76% of a token is disk; the arithmetic is 3%.** `chaos-kernelbench` (new)
times the expert FFN with weights already in RAM: 3.02 ms per block at **24.7
GiB/s**, which is *above* single-threaded memcpy on this machine. The kernel is
at DRAM speed and there is nothing to win in it.

**All four readers shared one file handle.** A Windows handle without
`FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED` is synchronous and the OS serialises reads on it, so the
drive never left queue depth 1. `chaos-iobench` (new), identical reads, one
variable:

| threads | shared handle | one handle each |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 4 | 2.01 GiB/s | **2.65** |
| 8 | 2.05 | **2.69** |

2.69 GiB/s is also above the 2.37 recorded as the drive's sequential ceiling.
Implemented: an 8-handle pool per shard, `READERS` 4 → 8, and `prefetch_dense`
reading a block's non-resident always-read tensors across the pool.

| | before | after | gain |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **expert slice reads** | 2.03 s | **1.54 s** | **1.32x** |
| dense re-reads, per GiB missing | 0.691 s | **0.496 s** | **1.39x** |

**1.32x on expert reads is the clean number** — independent of residency, and it
matches the bench's 1.31x prediction. The end-to-end rows (5.46 → 4.33 s/step,
0.182 → 0.227 tok/s) are **not** a clean A/B: the runs had 3.11 and 2.66 GiB
missing respectively. Normalised, the step gain is **1.19x**, and that is the
figure to quote. A clean end-to-end A/B needs stable free RAM and is not done.

This also corrects the speculative-decoding pessimism above: measured compute
scales as ~`n^0.49` in the batch, not linearly, so the byte table is a fair
estimate of total speedup rather than an optimistic one.

**Revised ceiling on this machine**: with residency satisfied and reads overlapped
with compute (R2, not done), a token is about `max(1.54, 0.6)` s ≈ **0.65 tok/s**
against llama.cpp's 0.39 — a real 1.7x lead rather than parity. Not 20 tok/s.
The remaining gap is entirely disk bandwidth against 3.21 GiB per token.

## Coverage: the Llama family now opens (2026-08-10)

Atur reset the goal: **standards-compliant, opens any model, matches or beats
llama.cpp on the criteria, all its options — then tag v0.0.X LTS, then 20 tok/s.**
The checklist that decides when LTS ships is
`docs/graph/backlog/lts-parity-criteria.md`; every row is done / gap / won't.

Coverage was the larger gap and had never been written down:

| | was | now | llama.cpp |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| architectures | 3 | **5 families** | ~100 |
| tokenizers | 1 (`gpt2`) | **2 (`gpt2`, `llama`)** | 6 |
| chat templates | 0 | 0 | ~40 |
| samplers | greedy only | greedy only | ~10 |

**Verified on real containers, not fixtures:**

| model | architecture | tokenizer | output |
|---|---|---|---|
| TinyLlama-1.1B | `llama` | SPM | "The capital of France is **Paris.**" |
| Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct | `llama` | BPE | "**Paris.** The capital of Germany is Berlin." |
| Qwen3-4B | `qwen3` | BPE | unchanged — no regression |

Three things were refusing the Llama family, and two would have shipped silently:

1. **QK norm was mandatory.** `required_tensors` listed `attn_q_norm`/
   `attn_k_norm` on every block; llama, mistral, qwen2, gemma and phi do not
   have them, so the up-front check was a false negative on all of them. Now
   detected from the container.
2. **RoPE type was hardcoded to NeoX.** llama.cpp uses NORM for llama/mistral
   and NeoX for qwen/phi/gemma. Both run without error on either layout — the
   wrong one is fluent nonsense. Now chosen by architecture, and an
   architecture *not* on the list is **flagged as a guess** in the runner's
   output rather than silently defaulted.
3. **SentencePiece did not exist.** It merges by vocabulary *score*, not by
   merge rank; space is `▁`; unknown text falls back to `<0xXX>` byte tokens.

**One real bug the round-trip test caught**: decoding tokens one at a time is
unsound for any multi-byte character — an emoji is four byte-fallback tokens,
and Persian or Chinese characters are two or three, so each fragment became `�`
permanently. `decode_bytes` returns bytes and generation now buffers to a valid
UTF-8 boundary. **This affected the BPE path too**, so it was breaking non-ASCII
output on every model, not just the new ones.

## C2 chat templates — instruct models now actually answer (2026-08-10)

The single largest quality gap, and it was invisible because nothing errored.

**Same model, same prompt, greedy decoding, Llama-3.2-1B:**

| | answer |
|---|---|
| raw prompt (before) | *"The sentence should be concise and evocative, using sensory details…"* |
| `--chat` (after) | *"The vast expanse of the ocean stretches out before us, a seemingly endless blue canvas of waves, tides, and mysteries…"* |

An instruct model handed raw text does not fail — it **completes the
instruction instead of following it**. Every quality impression of this runner
so far was formed against that.

**Detection, not Jinja evaluation.** GGUF stores the template as Jinja2;
Llama-3's alone uses `set`, `if defined`, loops and tool-call branches. llama.cpp
does not evaluate them either — it matches known families by substring and
applies a hardcoded formatter, and so does this. Nine families: chatml, llama3,
llama2, mistral, zephyr, phi3, gemma, vicuna, alpaca. An unrecognised template
reports itself **not recognised** rather than borrowing someone else's framing.

Verified against the real templates in the containers on this machine:

| model | template detected |
|---|---|
| TinyLlama-1.1B | zephyr |
| Llama-3.2-1B | llama3 |
| Qwen3-4B | chatml |

**The invisible half — control tokens.** Applying the template changed nothing
at first. `<|start_header_id|>` was being run through BPE and split into `<`,
`|`, `start`, … — pieces the model has never seen in that position — so the
framed prompt was just characters and the model answered as if given raw text.
There is no error anywhere in that path. `encode` now partitions on the
container's CONTROL and USER_DEFINED tokens and maps each to its own id;
the framed prompt above is **17 tokens**, not 40-odd.

`chaos-serve` now parses `messages[]` with roles in order and applies the
template, instead of concatenating the contents.

## C3 the server streams, samples and stops (2026-08-10)

`chaos-serve` answered one way: greedy, no sampling controls, and
`finish_reason` was **always** `"length"` because nothing checked for
end-of-sequence. It also buffered the whole answer before sending a byte.

Now:

| | |
|---|---|
| `stream: true` | server-sent events, one per token, flushed each time |
| sampling | `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `min_p`, `seed`, `repetition_penalty` |
| stopping | EOS **and** `stop` sequences → `finish_reason: "stop"` |
| `stop` | accepted as a string *or* an array, both spellings clients send |

Two details that would have been wrong quietly:

- **The default temperature is 1.0, not 0.0.** OpenAI's default is sampling;
  a client that sends no `temperature` does not expect greedy. `chaos-run`
  keeps greedy as its default for the opposite reason — it keeps a wrong
  forward pass diagnosable.
- **Stop sequences are matched against the accumulated text, not the token**,
  because a stop string can straddle a token boundary.
- Streaming re-uses the UTF-8 buffering rule: a chunk is emitted only at a
  character boundary, so a multi-byte character never becomes `�` mid-stream.

### Chat framing against llama.cpp, both paths — one bug, four open (2026-08-15)

`scripts/jinja-vs-llamacpp.py` claims in its docstring to compare "Chaos's Jinja
rendering against `llama.cpp --jinja`" and **never runs Chaos** — it runs
llama.cpp twice, `--jinja` against `--no-jinja`. That measurement is real and
worth keeping (the reference disagrees with **itself** on 5 of 18 containers) but
it was being cited for a claim it does not test. Same failure as the `REFUSED`
row: a description that outlived the code.

`scripts/jinja-chaos-vs-llamacpp.py` runs the four-way that does, on **token IDs
rather than rendered text**. It found a real bug on its first execution: **BOS was
being emitted twice** under `--jinja`, because the template contains the literal
`<bos>` *and* `encode` prepended one. gemma-3, Llama-3.2, internlm2, Phi-3 were
all prefilled a token **long** — the exact mirror of Falcon3, which was a token
short. Fixed; agreement went **4 → 6** of 14 loadable containers.

**A second silent bug, in the tokenizer.** A Phi-3 chat turn was **14 tokens
where llama.cpp makes 8** — identical input. llama.cpp drops whitespace
*following* a special token (`LLAMA_TOKEN_ATTR_RSTRIP`), and SPM's dummy prefix
then re-tokenizes the next word. **The attribute is not in the container**:
`llama-vocab.cpp` sets it from `_contains_any(model_name, {"phi-3", "phi3"})` —
the tokenizer's behaviour depends on `general.name`. Matched, with the same three
exemptions (`<unk>`, `<s>`, `<|endoftext|>`) and a test that any *other* model
keeps its whitespace. Agreement **6 → 7**; Phi-3 now matches on both paths.

**Neither bug was reachable from the parity sweep**, which uses plain prompts
with no special tokens — so none of the 104 prompts behind "102 exact" could have
found either, and both affect every chat-framed request the server handles. Two
different checks, two different bug classes.

Of the seven that still differ, three are models with **no chat template**
(`OLMo`, `starcoder2`, `all-MiniLM`), where llama.cpp passes the text through
untouched and we impose a `System:/User:/Assistant:` framing. Deliberate and
announced, but a divergence, and feeding a base model invented structure is the
mirror of the bug that made instruct models continue rather than answer. **Not
changed** — a product decision, recorded so it gets made rather than inherited.
One (`tinyllama`, family path) is us matching the model's template where
llama.cpp's hardcoded renderer does not. Three are genuine rendering differences
(`Falcon3`, `gemma-2`, `internlm2`). Full table:
`research/chat-framing-vs-llamacpp-2026-08-15.md`.

### `/v1/embeddings` — the fifth endpoint, implemented 2026-08-15

It answered **501** with a reason that was half true: *"this runner's graph
returns logits, not hidden states."* True of what the graph **returned**, false
about what it **computed** — the pre-projection hidden state is the input to the
vocabulary matmul and was being discarded one line later. A refusal that cites a
missing capability should be checked against the code, not against the last
person who wrote it down.

Taken **after `output_norm` and before the vocabulary projection**, which is
where llama.cpp takes it. Earlier, the vector carries a per-model scale that
makes similarity between two models meaningless; later, it is a distribution over
tokens rather than an embedding. Opt-in per pass (`set_want_embedding`), so
generation does not pay for a `compute` the sampler never reads.

**Verified semantically, not just structurally** — the old message warned that a
vector derived from the wrong place "would look like an embedding and behave like
noise", so returning 2048 plausible floats proves nothing:

```
cos(cat, dog) = 0.5867
cos(cat, SQL) = 0.2063
cos(dog, SQL) = 0.1585      L2 norms: 1.0, 1.0, 1.0
```

`input` is accepted as a **string or an array of strings**, both of which are in
real client code, and each input gets a **fresh KV cache** — sharing one would
make every vector after the first depend on the texts before it, and they would
still look plausible while silently encoding the batch order.

Still refused, by name: the **V4-Flash** path, whose forward pass does not expose
a hidden state. That is a different engine, not a missing line.

**The server now serves any supported architecture.** It refused everything
except V4-Flash, which made the one component an agent actually talks to
useless for the models people actually run. Verified end to end:

| model | template | result |
|---|---|---|
| Llama-3.2-1B | llama3 | `"Pacific Ocean"`, `finish_reason: "stop"` |
| TinyLlama-1.1B | zephyr | answers, SPM tokenizer, same binary |

`/v1/models` reports the container's own name (`Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct`), not a
constant. A stop sequence truncates correctly: asking it to repeat
"alpha beta gamma delta" with `stop: ["gamma"]` returns `"alpha beta "` and
`finish_reason: "stop"`.

One wire-format bug caught by looking at the raw bytes rather than trusting the
code: the SSE headers were being emitted with **leading whitespace**, because a
multi-line string literal in the source kept its indentation. `curl` tolerated
it; a stricter client would not.

## The first dense head-to-head (2026-08-10) — and it is a deficit

Every previous comparison was on a model that streams from disk, where I/O
dominates. **Qwen3-4B fits in RAM, so this is the first measurement of the
compute path on its own.** Both command lines and outputs:
`docs/graph/research/qwen3-4b-vs-llamacpp-2026-08-10.md`.

| Qwen3-4B dense, CPU, 20 threads | Chaos | llama.cpp | verdict |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| prefill (matched, 519 vs 512) | **83.4 tok/s** | **88.3** | **1.06x behind** |
| generation (128 tok, 3 reps) | **4.3 tok/s** | **5.28 ± 0.33** (tg128) | **1.23x behind** |

*(The original 38.5 / 0.67 figures were taken on the uncached path with a
broken arena; both are superseded.)*

**The prefill gap is weight repacking, and nothing else.** Same file, same
prompt, `llama-completion` both sides:

| Qwen3-4B prefill | tok/s |
|---|---:|
| llama.cpp, repacking on (default) | **88.26** |
| llama.cpp, `--no-repack` | 63.68 |
| Chaos | 60.29 |

**Without repacking the two engines are 6% apart** — expected, since both link
the same ggml. Ruled out by measurement on the way: thread count (8–20 all
within 10%), graph/threadpool overhead (~0.2% of the pass), and the matmul
kernel itself (our FFN runs at 472 GFLOP/s against a measured Q4_K ceiling of
420). Detail and the command lines:
`docs/graph/research/qwen3-4b-vs-llamacpp-2026-08-10.md`.

**Built, and now ON by default:**

| Qwen3-4B prefill, 519 tokens | tok/s |
|---|---:|
| llama.cpp | 88.3 |
| **Chaos** | **83.4** |
| Chaos, `--no-repack` | 58.6 |

**1.42x, and the prefill deficit goes 1.46x → 1.06x.** 216 tensors, 1.64 GiB
rearranged.

It reaches `ggml`'s repacked kernels without adopting `ggml-backend`: a tensor
allocated in the repack buffer type gets `tensor_traits` hung off its `extra`,
and `ggml_compute_forward` consults that **on the plain graph path too**.

**It defaults ON because it is the side that AGREES WITH llama.cpp** — which is
the opposite of how it first looked. Enabling it changed Llama-3.2's
continuation, which read as a regression until the reference was actually
consulted. Raw greedy completion, same container:

| prompt | llama.cpp | Chaos repacked | Chaos unpacked |
|---|---|---|---|
| "The largest ocean on Earth is the" | "Pacific Ocean, covering an area of approximately" | **same** | "which covers an area of" |
| "Water boils at" | "100 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure" | same | same |

**The repacked path matches; the unpacked one is the outlier.** Whatever the
residual difference in the plain Q4_K path is, repacking is the side that
reproduces the reference implementation — so it is the better default on
correctness grounds *before* the 1.42x is counted. `--no-repack` turns it off.

Three uses break on a repacked tensor and none fail loudly, so all three are
excluded:

- **`get_rows`** — `token_embd` is indexed by token id and repacked rows are
  interleaved. Llama-3.2 ties it to the output projection, so repacking it
  corrupted both at once.
- **`view_2d` by byte offset** — Phi-3's fused `attn_qkv` and `ffn_up` are split
  into q/k/v and gate/up that way. Repacking them made Phi-3 emit
  `[PAD32063]rit[PAD32063]…`.
All five architectures answer correctly, and the 19 container-backed V4-Flash
tests still pass — that path binds through `ResidentSet` rather than
`load_resident`, so it is untouched and could take the same win later.

### The V4-Flash path cannot take that win, and trying found a crash (2026-08-10)

**"The same 1.42x is sitting there for V4-Flash" is false on x86, and the number
is 0 tensors, not 1.42x.** Detail and both engines' output:
`docs/graph/research/v4flash-repacking-2026-08-10.md`.

`ggml_repack_get_optimal_repack_type` branches on the **CPU** as well as the
tensor, and `Q8_0` has no x86 branch at all — its repacked kernels are NEON and
RISC-V only. Every always-read tensor in `V4-Flash-UD-Q4_K_XL` with a repackable
shape is `Q8_0`; the rest are F32 or BF16. Measured: **42 offered, 42 declined,
0 repacked.** The container upcasts exactly the tensors repacking would help.

**llama.cpp is worse off on the same file, not better**: with repacking on (its
default) it does not load at all, because its repack buffer is one range for the
whole model —

```
E alloc_tensor_range: failed to allocate CPU_REPACK buffer of size 147169738752
E llama_model_load: error loading model: unable to allocate CPU_REPACK buffer
```

137 GiB. That is why every V4-Flash figure here passes `--no-repack`, a quirk
that had been recorded without its cause. Chaos repacks per tensor, so the same
container loads, reports `0 repacked`, and runs. **No tok/s is won by this** —
it is a difference in kind, and `--no-repack` gets llama.cpp running too.

**A crash was already shipping.** ggml's repack `init_tensor` sets
`tensor->extra` to `nullptr` when there is no kernel and returns
`GGML_STATUS_SUCCESS`; `set_tensor` then dereferences it. No assert, no error
code — `STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION` and the process is gone. `is_repackable`
accepts `Q8_0` and `Q2_K`, so **any `*.Q8_0.gguf` would have killed `chaos-run`
on x86 before printing a token.** None of the Q4_K_M containers here hold a
`Q8_0` 2-D weight, which is the only reason it had never been seen. `repack` now
reads what ggml actually decided instead of trusting the shape check.

The machinery was kept and is verified: `RepackedDense` rearranges once at load
(V4-Flash rebuilds its `WeightSet` per block, so rearranging in the bind loop
would redo the whole set 43 times per token), hands the bytes over out of the
resident set rather than duplicating them, and re-attaches per block. Checked
numerically on x86 with `Q4_K` against ggml's own ordinary kernel, bound into two
contexts from one rearrangement. An ARM build gets the win for free.

**FIXED the same day.** The cause was one branch condition: `forward_cached`
already had a working KV cache but was only reached `if config.is_moe()`, so
dense models fell through to a stateless path that rebuilt the whole sequence
per token. Routing them through it needed two guards the streaming path lacked
— QK norm (Qwen3-only) and the RoPE type (NORM for llama, NeoX for qwen).

| generation, 128 tokens | before | after | llama.cpp | verdict |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| **Qwen3-4B** | 0.67 tok/s | **4.27** | 5.90 | 8.8x behind → **1.38x** |
| **Llama-3.2-1B** | — | **10.12** | 12.91 | **1.28x behind** |

Cached and uncached produce **byte-identical** text on Qwen3-4B;
`CHAOS_UNCACHED=1` keeps the old path reachable so that stays checkable.

Two bugs found while measuring, both fixed:

- **A 651-token prompt aborted the process.** The dense arena was a hardcoded
  2 GiB, and `ggml` answers exhaustion with `GGML_ASSERT`, not an error. The
  arena is now computed from the shape — and the term that was missing is that
  it is **per layer**: one graph spans all 36 blocks in one context and `ggml`
  frees nothing inside a context. `chaos-run` now refuses a prompt that will
  not fit, naming the arena needed and the longest prompt that would work.
- **The output projection ran on every position.** `build_graph` projected the
  whole sequence through the 151936-wide output matrix and used one row — 253
  GFLOP wasted on a 651-token prompt. Now only the final position is projected.

## A8: unverified architectures are now refused, not answered wrongly

Downloaded Gemma-2-2b and Phi-3-mini to verify A4/A5 rather than guess. They
failed in the two opposite ways, and only one of them is safe:

| model | outcome |
|---|---|
| **Phi-3-mini** | fails cleanly — `container has no tensor "blk.0.attn_q.weight"` (fused QKV) |
| **Gemma-2-2b** | **loads, runs, and answers "The capital of France is" with `himſelf`** |

Gemma-2 needs post-norms after attention and the FFN, logit soft-capping,
attention soft-capping, embedding scaling by `sqrt(n_embd)` and sliding-window
attention on alternate layers. **None of those announce themselves as a missing
tensor**, so the generic dense path ran it and produced confident nonsense.

That is the failure mode this project is most expensive at, and it is the one
thing a runner whose pitch is *"it tells you the truth about your machine"*
cannot do. So `VERIFIED_ARCHITECTURES` is now a list of what has actually been
run and read — `deepseek4, llama, qwen3, qwen3moe` — and anything else is
**refused with the reason**. `chaos-run --force` runs it anyway; **the server
does not offer that escape hatch at all**, because an API client has no way to
see that an answer is unsound.

**Phi-3 is now supported and verified** (same day): it fuses *both* Q/K/V into
one `attn_qkv` and the FFN gate/up into one `ffn_up`, and both split into views
along whole quantisation blocks, so the fix is free at runtime. It answers "The
capital of France is" with "Paris." and "2 + 2 =" with "4", matching llama.cpp's
own output on the same container. `VERIFIED_ARCHITECTURES` is now
**deepseek4, llama, phi3, qwen3, qwen3moe**.

A silent bug found alongside it: **the RoPE frequency base defaulted to 1e6**,
which was Qwen3's *declared* value generalised into a fallback. Phi-3 declares
none, so it was being rotated at 100x the right frequency. llama.cpp's default
is 10000 and that is now ours. Qwen3 (1e6) and Llama-3.2 (5e5) declare theirs,
so nothing regressed — checked on all four.

**Gemma-2 is now supported too.** It needed four things, none of which announce
themselves: post-norms after attention *and* the FFN, attention-logit
soft-capping at 50 (which has to go **into** the fused kernel — those logits do
not exist outside it), final-logit soft-capping at 30, and embedding scaling by
`sqrt(n_embd)`. Output now matches llama.cpp exactly, markdown and all:

```
llama.cpp   The capital of France is **Paris**. 🇫
Chaos      The capital of France is **Paris**.
```

**Its 4096-token sliding window is not implemented, so anything past 4096 is
refused** — below the window every layer is effectively full attention, so short
sequences are exactly right and long ones would silently let the local layers
see too far. That is a limit of this implementation, not of the architecture,
and it says so.

`VERIFIED_ARCHITECTURES` is now **deepseek4, gemma2, llama, phi3, qwen3,
qwen3moe** — six families, from two at the start of the day.

## V4-Flash is re-verified after today's changes

Today touched code V4-Flash shares with the dense path — `flash_attn_ext` gained
a `logit_softcap` argument, `threads()` stopped defaulting to a hardcoded 12,
and the RoPE frequency default changed. **All 19 container-backed V4-Flash tests
pass**, including the ones comparing element sums against llama.cpp captures:

```
cargo test --release --test deepseek4_forward -- --ignored
test result: ok. 19 passed; 0 failed  (272s)
```

**And they can now actually be run.** They aborted the whole test binary when
run in parallel: 19 tests each allocating GB-sized arenas exhausted memory, and
`ggml` answers that with `GGML_ASSERT(ctx->mem_buffer != NULL)`, which kills the
process. It surfaced as `error: test failed ... process didn't exit
successfully` rather than as a failing test, and every result after the abort
was lost — so in practice they had stopped being run. They now share a `heavy()`
lock, and the plain command above works without `--test-threads=1`.

## Generation: q, k and v now share one graph — 1.30x

`compute()` re-evaluates the **whole ancestor graph** of its output. The Q/K/V
phase called it three times, once per tensor, so the normalisation they share
ran three times and it paid three graph builds and three threadpool cycles per
layer per token. At one token those fixed costs dominate: the matmuls are
matrix-*vector* products and tiny.

The comment above the code already said *"one compute materialises all three;
they share a graph"*. The code did not.

`Context::compute_many` expands one graph with several roots. Measured on
Qwen3-4B, 96 tokens:

| Qwen3-4B, 96 tokens | before | after |
|---|---:|---:|
| generation | 3.94 tok/s | **5.13** |
| Q/K/V phase | 8.3 s | **5.3 s** |

**1.30x**, and output is unchanged on all five architectures.

**The deficit that follows from it is 1.23x, not 1.15x**, and the difference is
a lesson rather than a rounding error. 5.13 was measured at 96 tokens against a
llama.cpp run that happened to report 5.90; re-measured at the *same* 128 tokens
`llama-bench` uses, with 3 repetitions, llama.cpp is **5.28 ± 0.33** and Chaos
is **4.3**. Generation slows as context grows, so a shorter run flatters us —
and a single un-repeated reference run has a ±0.33 spread that is a third of the
gap being claimed. Both sides now get matched length and repetitions.

Llama-3.2-1B, same treatment: Chaos **13.5**, llama.cpp **16.21 ± 0.29** —
**1.20x behind**. An earlier single llama.cpp run read 12.91, which would have
made this a *win*. It is not one.

This is the third time this exact fact has cost time — it is already in
`CLAUDE.md` as *"24 calls per block became 6 — 1.9x"*. Worth grepping for
`compute(` in any hot loop before assuming the arithmetic is the cost.

## `-t` was never plumbed, and the default was the worst setting (2026-08-10)

Full write-up, every command line both sides:
`docs/graph/research/threads-were-never-plumbed-2026-08-10.md`.

`-t N` set `CHAOS_THREADS` and **only `deepseek4_forward.rs` read it.** Every
other architecture computed its own count from `available_parallelism()`. What
exposed it: `-t 1` and `-t 20` produced *bit-identical* phase timings. An
earlier sweep reading 4.07/4.00/4.31/4.67 tok/s had been recorded as "threads
are not the lever" — it was six measurements of one configuration.

**A sweep whose knob is disconnected is indistinguishable from a flat response.**
Confirm the knob moves something before concluding it moves nothing.

Once connected, generation and prefill turned out to want opposite counts, so
there are now two — `-t` and llama.cpp's `-tb` / `--threads-batch` — chosen by
the token count of the step, not the call site:

| threads | Qwen3-4B gen | Llama-3.2-1B gen | Qwen3-4B prefill |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2 | **7.64** | **21.95** | — |
| 4 | 7.51 | 21.45 | 47.4 |
| 8 | 6.24 | 16.78 | 70.9 |
| 20 (the old default) | 4.49 | 12.22 | **81.5** |

Generation streams every weight once per token and saturates DRAM long before it
runs out of cores; prefill multiplies a whole block and scales with cores.
llama.cpp shows the same curve on this machine, so it is the hardware, not us.

**A calibration that failed and was deleted**: a 150 ms DRAM-saturation
microbenchmark at load chose 6, 8, 12, 12, 4, 6 on six consecutive runs while
the optimum was 2-4, and its spread (5.51-8.20) was worse than the bad default
it replaced. A pure read has no per-node barrier; a ggml graph does. *A proxy
that must be corrected until it agrees with the objective is the objective,
measured badly.* What shipped instead tunes on **real generated tokens** and
stops after ~4 of them.

Interleaved A/B, same session, `-n 64`, 3 reps:

| | tuned (new default) | `-t 20` (old default) | |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Qwen3-4B | **8.01** | 4.83 | **1.66x** |
| Llama-3.2-1B | **20.05** | 11.89 | **1.69x** |

### Against llama.cpp — both cells, neither quotable alone

| generation | Chaos | llama.cpp | verdict |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Qwen3-4B, **both at default** | **8.01** | 6.52 ± 0.33 (t=10) | **1.23x ahead** |
| Llama-3.2-1B, **both at default** | 20.05 | 20.91 ± 0.65 (t=10) | 1.04x — parity |
| Qwen3-4B, **both hand-tuned** | 7.64 (t=2) | 9.16 ± 0.43 (t=4) | 1.20x behind |
| Llama-3.2-1B, **both hand-tuned** | 21.95 (t=2) | 27.85 ± 1.98 (t=4) | 1.27x behind |

Out of the box we lead on Qwen3-4B because we measure the machine and llama.cpp
uses a fixed default. **Given equal care on both sides llama.cpp is still
faster.** The hand-tuned deficit (1.20x) matches what was recorded before any of
this work (1.23x), which is what says the ratio is real rather than an artefact
of where on the curve each engine was sitting.

Output is byte-identical at 2 and 20 threads on all five verified dense
architectures. 235 tests pass.

### The MoE path wanted ONE thread, and nobody had checked

The tuner picked 1 thread for Qwen3-30B-A3B. That looked like a bug — its signal
is disk-dominated on a streaming model — so the tuner now subtracts read time and
measures only what the knob affects. It still picked 1, three runs in a row, and
a direct sweep says it is right:

| threads | Qwen3-30B gen | expert compute |
|---:|---:|---:|
| **1** | **2.88 tok/s** | 2.2 s |
| 4 | 2.23 | 2.9 s |
| 8 | 1.80 | 3.6 s |
| 20 — *the old default* | 1.21 | 5.2 s |

**2.4x, and expert compute more than doubles as threads are added.** Each expert
matmul at one token is a 768x2048 matrix-vector; a layer's graph holds 24 of
them, and splitting each across 20 threads leaves ~38 rows per thread per
barrier. The threads cost more than the work.

llama.cpp peaks at **4 threads** on the same model where we peak at 1, which
says its expert path parallelises and ours does not. **That is the lead for the
remaining 1.60x**, now scoped with its arithmetic in
`docs/graph/backlog/batch-the-expert-matmuls.md`: the expert path runs at
**3.7 GB/s** where the dense FFN runs at ~13, so the headroom is per-node
overhead (1,152 tensor binds and ~2,300 graph nodes per token), not bandwidth.
**Built, measured, reverted — it does not pay on the streaming path.** The
batched `mul_mat_id` form is genuinely faster (expert compute 7.0 s → 4.2 s over
24 tokens, output byte-identical), but the selected experts arrive as unrelated
`Arc<[u8]>` and making them contiguous costs ~1.02 GB of copying per token —
about what the kernel saves. Generation went **1.34 → 1.27 tok/s**.

`chaos-kernelbench`'s 11.17 GiB/s for the batched form is real and was
misleading: **it binds the model's already-stacked expert tensor zero-copy.** A
kernel benchmark measures the kernel, not the data movement needed to feed it.

**The version that would pay is a different ticket**: bind the whole stacked
expert tensor with the real ids and copy nothing — which needs the experts
*resident*. Qwen3-30B-A3B is 17.28 GiB and fits on a 32 GB machine, so a
residency-dependent expert path is worth having, and it belongs with the
tok/s-versus-RAM frontier work. Full numbers:
`docs/graph/backlog/batch-the-expert-matmuls.md`.

`llama-bench -m Qwen3-30B-A3B-Q4_K_M.gguf -n 32 -p 0 -r 2 -t 1,4,10`:
1.95 ± 0.64 / **4.21 ± 0.28** / 3.64 ± 0.22.

### V4-Flash has the same curve and still has its old default — 1.28x unclaimed

`deepseek4_forward.rs` reads `CHAOS_THREADS` directly and does not go through
the tuner, so the flagship model still defaults to every core:

| threads | 1 | 2 | **4** | 8 | 20 *(its default)* |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| V4-Flash generation | 0.331 | 0.378 | **0.380** | 0.346 | 0.296 |

**Done once r9 was merged in.** `deepseek4_forward.rs` now splits the count the
same way the dense path does, and the split had to be measured in *both*
directions because a blanket cap was tried first and would have traded one
regression for the other:

| V4-Flash, back to back | 4 threads | all cores |
|---|---:|---:|
| generation | **0.196** | 0.177 |
| prefill, 180 tokens | 2.24 | **2.89** |

**Prefill loses 1.29x at four threads; generation loses 1.11x at twenty.** So
`threads()` reads the batch size set by `forward`, the single funnel both
`prefill` and `step` pass through.

**This retires a note that was in `CLAUDE.md`** — "4/12/20 threads all cost the
same on a V4-Flash prefill". True at 5 tokens, where the pass is almost entirely
disk; false at 180.

**V4-Flash absolute numbers drift hard with page-cache state.** The same
`-t 4` vs `-t 20` comparison read 0.380/0.296 earlier in the day and 0.196/0.177
after a dozen heavy runs. Only compare within one session.

One trap on the way: the first version of the split called `std::env::var`
inside `threads()`, which is called at every `ctx.compute` — thousands of times
per token. Locking the environment and allocating a `String` that often cost
more than the split saved, taking generation to 0.267, *below* the 0.296 it was
meant to fix. Both counts are resolved once now.

## Gemma-2 sliding-window attention (2026-08-10) — the 4096 refusal is gone

Detail and command lines: `docs/graph/research/gemma2-sliding-window-2026-08-10.md`.

Gemma-2 alternates a sliding-window layer with a full-attention one. Neither the
window nor a way to live without it existed, so anything past 4096 tokens was
refused. Now the even layers get a second mask with the old keys closed off.

Verified three ways, because two of them prove nothing alone:

1. **Below the window** output is unchanged (`**Paris**.`) — a regression check.
2. **Above the window** (5201 tokens, greedy, `-no-cnv` on both sides) Chaos and
   llama.cpp produce the same continuation.
3. **The layer parity is load-bearing** — flipping it to odd-slide changes the
   output on the same prompt. Without this, check 2 is also consistent with the
   window never being applied, because a repetitive prompt continues itself.

`-no-cnv` matters: without it `llama-completion` applies Gemma's chat template
and answers as an assistant, and the two engines are not doing the same work.

### Three arenas were short; reading ggml's error correctly found the one that mattered

**`available` in `not enough space in the context's memory pool` is the pool's
total size, not the remainder.** Reading it as the remainder points at whichever
arena was nearly full instead of the one that was too small, and cost two wrong
fixes. `56,624,208 ≈ 3 × 18,874,368` identified it exactly: `post_norm` budgeted
one `n_embd × n_new` tensor and allocated three. Gemma-only, which is why nothing
else ever hit it. The dense-FFN and attention arenas were under-counted too and
are fixed here; they would have aborted at a larger block.

**`arena_for` doubles its total, and that doubling is what hides an undercount
until the block grows enough to eat it.**

### Prefill: not a win, and it nearly got quoted as one

| Gemma-2-2b prefill, 5200 tokens | best of each | verdict |
|---|---:|---|
| llama.cpp | **127.35** (t=20) | — |
| Chaos | 114.99 (t=4) | **1.11x behind** |

At `-t 4` on both sides it reads 114.99 against 76.76 — 1.50x ahead — because
prefill wants every core and llama.cpp was being handicapped. Run the opposing
command at the setting its own author would choose.

## Quality is measured now — perplexity, and it agrees with llama.cpp (2026-08-10)

Every correctness check in this project had been *"does it say Paris"*, which
catches a broken forward pass and nothing subtler. `chaos-run --ppl-chunk N`
reports perplexity with llama.cpp's exact windowing:

| perplexity, 128-token chunks | Chaos | llama.cpp | difference |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct Q4_K_M | **29.0909** | 29.2456 ± 6.49 | **0.53%** |
| Qwen3-4B Q4_K_M | **33.6434** | 34.0293 ± 9.64 | **1.13%** |

Two architectures, two tokenizer families. It exercises the tokenizer, RoPE, the
causal mask, the KV cache, fused attention, repacking and the output projection
against an independent implementation, on a number that would move if any were
wrong. **Both sit inside llama.cpp's own error bar — this is agreement, not a
claim to be more accurate.**

**The windowing is the measurement**, and both details were wrong first time:
including one 98-token remainder alongside three full chunks took the answer
from 29.25 to **33.65**, and scoring from position 1 instead of the second half
gave **1.9232**, which looks spectacular and means nothing. Match the chunk size
and the corpus or you are comparing windowings.
`docs/graph/research/perplexity-2026-08-10.md`.

## CLI parity with llama.cpp (2026-08-11) — 21 flags to 106, counted properly

Full table and every refusal with its reason:
`docs/graph/backlog/llamacpp-flag-audit.md`.

llama.cpp has **182** long flags, counted from `llama-completion --help`. The
parity doc had said "~100", which was a guess. Chaos now accepts **106**.

| bucket | | state |
|---|---:|---|
| samplers | 22 | **21 done** — only `--backend-sampling` (a GPU concept) left |
| interaction | 22 | **done**, including a REPL and `--interactive-first` |
| logging | 13 | **11 done**; status moved to **stderr** |
| RoPE / YaRN | 15 | **9 done**, 6 refused |
| KV type + prompt cache | 7 | **done** |
| runtime / memory | 31 | I/O mode, `--override-kv`, `--mlock`; **most refused with reasons** |
| GPU | 15 | **10 done** — `--device`/`--main-gpu`, `--list-devices`, `-ngl`/`--gpu-layers`/`--n-gpu-layers`, `-ot`/`--override-tensor`, `--op-offload`; 5 refused, and `--split-mode`/`--tensor-split` need a second usable device this machine does not have |
| grammar / JSON schema | 4 | the r10 worktree session owns this |

**Nothing is accepted that does nothing.** ~20 flags are refused outright with a
written reason — `--keep` (no context shift), `--numa`, `--parallel`,
`--cpu-mask`, `--defrag-thold`, `--swa-full`, `--jinja`, and the GPU set. That
standard exists because `-t` was accepted, echoed and ignored for weeks.

### What the flag work found, which is the point of doing it by hand

Six flags were **accepted and silently did nothing** before being fixed:

- `-t` reached one architecture of six. `-t 1` and `-t 20` gave *bit-identical*
  phase timings. Connecting it was **1.66x**, and led to the MoE expert path
  wanting **one** thread (**2.46x** on Qwen3-30B) and V4-Flash wanting four.
- `--logit-bias` and `--ignore-eos` were skipped by the greedy short-circuit at
  temperature 0, which is the default.
- `--mirostat 2` produced **byte-identical output to greedy** — twice, through
  two different early returns.
- `--chat-template` landed on the deepseek4 path only, so it did nothing on
  every model anyone would test it with.

Each was invisible to a test that checks the process exits zero. They were found
by running the flag and reading the *output* — or the token ids, when the header
would have lied.

### Two numbers of my own that were wrong

- **The flag count** was measured from the help text for eight commits, which
  lists each flag under one spelling. 81 was an undercount of 25. *Measure the
  thing, not a description of the thing.*
- **Batching the expert matmuls** was scoped at ~1.45x from a kernel benchmark,
  built, and reverted: making the streamed experts contiguous costs what the
  batched kernel saves. A kernel benchmark measures the kernel, not the data
  movement needed to feed it.

### Quality is measured now

`--ppl-chunk N` reports perplexity with llama.cpp's windowing. Llama-3.2-1B
**29.0909 vs 29.2456**; Qwen3-4B **33.6434 vs 34.0293** — 0.53% and 1.13% on two
architectures and two tokenizer families. That same tool then measured the
quantised KV cache: **q8_0 costs 0.64% of perplexity for roughly half the
memory**.

## Gemma was running the wrong activation (2026-08-11) — and `VERIFIED` was wrong

**`gemma2` was in `VERIFIED_ARCHITECTURES` and had never been diffed against
llama.cpp.** Its output is now identical; it was not before.

```
chaos (before)  **Paris**.
llama.cpp        :  a) Paris  b) Lyon  c) Marseille  d)
```

Two bugs, both silent by construction:

1. **SiLU where the whole Gemma family uses GELU.** `grep -rn "gelu" crates/`
   returned nothing — every gated FFN in the crate was SwiGLU. Nothing in a
   container records the activation: a GELU model and a SiLU model hold
   **byte-identical tensor sets**, so this is not a missing tensor, not a shape
   error and not a crash. It is a model that keeps answering in English and
   disagrees with the reference from the first token. Now `FfnAct`, chosen by
   architecture, applied in one place. **This alone fixed Gemma-3.**
2. **The scale went to the kernel instead of into Q.** llama.cpp pre-scales Q
   by `1/sqrt(head_dim)` and passes `scale = 1.0`; ggml folds the soft cap into
   the scale (`scale /= cap`), so the two are the same algebra and
   `0.0625f/50f` vs `0.0625f*(1f/50f)` differ by **one ULP**. Through the cap's
   `tanh` that flipped Gemma-2's first token between `:` and ` Paris`, and with
   it the whole completion. **A soft cap turns a scale into a non-linearity's
   argument** — match the reference's order, not its algebra.

Also fixed: the Gemma **27B-only** attention scale (`n_embd/n_head`, not
`head_dim`), which coincides at every other size — a check that passed here
would still have been wrong at 27B.

**Verified**: 3 prompts x 32 tokens x both engines, `--temp 0`, back to back.
`gemma-2-2b-it` and `gemma-3-1b-it` identical token for token; llama, qwen2 and
qwen3-4b re-checked and unchanged. Architectures **7 -> 8**, tests **409 ->
411**, clippy 0, fmt clean.

New: **`print_hparams` at `-v`** — llama.cpp has printed its hyper-parameters at
load since the beginning, and the hours spent guessing which scale Gemma-2 used
were hours nobody with that output would have spent. It prints *derived* values
(`attn_scale`, per-layer RoPE bases, the windowed-layer list), because a key
read under the wrong name looks exactly like a key that was absent.

Full account: `docs/graph/research/gemma-was-running-silu-2026-08-11.md`.

### Every architecture re-checked, and greedy decoding is not always reproducible

`scripts/parity-check.sh` diffs both engines on three prompts at `--temp 0`.
Seven containers, six architectures: **19 of 21 exact, 0 failures.**

The two exceptions are the finding. **llama.cpp disagrees with itself** on
them — `def fibonacci(n):` on Llama-3.2-1B answers "up to the nth term" with
`-fa on` and "the first n Fibonacci numbers" with `-fa off`; `The capital of
France is` on Phi-3 changes under `--no-repack`. Both flags only reorder a sum.
Those prompts sit on a near-tie, and any engine that accumulates differently
lands on the other side and writes a different paragraph.

So token-for-token identity is not always an achievable target. The script
re-runs the reference under a second configuration before calling anything a
failure and reports `unstable` instead — **a test whose expected value is not
reproducible in the reference must say so rather than fail.** Gemma was not
this: its reference was stable and we were wrong.


## Six more flags, and a list that could not be trusted (2026-08-11)

`--binary-file`, `--chat-template-file`, `--log-colors`/`--no-log-colors`,
`--prio`/`--prio-batch`, `--warmup`/`--no-warmup`, `--completion-bash`. Each
was checked to change something observable before being accepted, which is the
standard `-t` failed for weeks. Two came off the **refused** list:

- **`--prio` was refused for "no thread-affinity or scheduler layer".** Wrong
  premise — process priority needs one syscall, not an affinity layer. It is
  real now, applied before the model opens so the load benefits. **`--prio 3`
  maps to HIGH, not REALTIME, and says so**: realtime outranks the kernel's
  own input and disk threads and can leave a desktop with no way to click
  anything.
- **`--warmup` was refused for "nothing is warmed".** Also wrong: the page
  cache, the repacked tensors, the arenas and the thread ladder all are. It
  runs one throwaway pass on a discarded cache. **Off by default, unlike
  llama.cpp** — warming a disk-streaming runner reads gigabytes, and the cold
  cost is the number this project exists to report honestly.

### The completion list drifted in both directions inside an hour

Hand-written from the help text, it claimed **four flags that do not exist**
and was **missing 23 that do**. A phantom flag is worse than a missing one:
the shell suggests it and the binary rejects it.

Same failure as the flag count this project carried for eight commits.
**Anything that enumerates the flags is a second copy of the parser and will
drift**, so `build.rs` now scans `chaos-run.rs` for the string literals its
`match` arms are made of and generates the list: **119 long flags**, 0 phantom,
0 missing.

## Chat templates 25 -> 54, and 11 of the old ones were wrong (2026-08-11)

llama.cpp knows 54 template names. Chaos knew 25 — **and eleven of those
rendered differently from the reference**, which nothing had ever checked.

The oracle is `scripts/capture-chat-templates.py`: it runs llama.cpp with
`--verbose-prompt` and reconstructs, token by token, the exact prompt it builds
for every template it knows. That capture is a fixture in the repo and a test
replays all of it. "Chaos supports `gpt-oss`" now means **byte-identical to
llama.cpp on a recorded command line**, not "it looked right".

**52 of 54 match exactly.** The two skipped are Hunyuan variants whose bytes the
capture model's tokenizer cannot round-trip; baking a corrupted expectation in
would be worse than not comparing.

### The eleven that were already wrong

| family | what it did | what llama.cpp does |
|---|---|---|
| `llama2` | emitted the `<<SYS>>` block | plain — that block is `llama2-sys` |
| `llama2-sys` | `<<SYS>>` *before* `[INST]` | `[INST] ` first, `<<SYS>>` inside it |
| `falcon3` | shared RWKV-World's `System:` framing | `<\|system\|>`-shaped, nothing alike |
| `zephyr` | the container's EOS | hardcodes `<\|endoftext\|>` |
| `granite` (x3) | a newline after `<\|end_of_role\|>` | no newline |
| `chatglm3` | no preamble, no space | `[gMASK]sop` and a space after the role |
| `chatglm4` | no trailing newline | `<\|assistant\|>
` |
| `deepseek` | blank lines between turns | single newlines |
| `minicpm` | labelled the system turn `<AI>` | emits it raw |
| `monarch` | Bailing's `<role>HUMAN</role>` | `<s>role
content</s>` — a different family |
| `orion` | dropped the system turn's `Human: ` | opens `Human: ` on the system turn |

`glmedge` was aliased to `chatglm4` and `bailing` to `monarch`; both are
separate families, so those containers were fed two tokens at position 0 they
were never trained to see.

**A wrong template does not fail.** The model answers, fluently, having been
handed a framing it has never seen — it comments on the question instead of
answering it, or answers the system prompt. No test that checks "did it produce
a string" can see that, which is why the expectation had to come from llama.cpp
rather than from me.

One place we deliberately differ, and it is recorded in the code: llama.cpp's
Zephyr renderer hardcodes `<|endoftext|>` because its renderers have no
vocabulary to read. **TinyLlama uses the Zephyr framing with `</s>`**, and its
own Jinja template says `eos_token`, so the reference frames it with a token it
has never seen. `eos_or` prefers the container's EOS when there is one and
falls back to llama.cpp's literal when there is not — the fixture test passes
`""` and so reproduces llama.cpp exactly.

## Samplers 16 -> 20: parity (2026-08-11)

| sampler | what it is |
|---|---|
| `--adaptive-target` / `--adaptive-decay` | aim for a token of a given *probability*, with the target moving as it observes what it actually picked — a feedback controller like mirostat, not a filter |
| `--infill` | suppress fill-in-the-middle control tokens |
| `--grammar-lazy` | hold a grammar back until the model writes a trigger, then constrain everything after it |

Chaos now implements **20 of llama.cpp's 20** sampler entry points.

**Adaptive-p was written in the wrong slot first**, and the mistake is worth
recording because it looked plausible: it went next to mirostat, *before* the
truncations, since both replace the temperature tail. The transform hands every
token whose probability is near the target the same peak logit — so on an
untruncated 150k vocabulary it spread the mass across the whole dictionary and
produced `LOGGER冲突ユー ihm definit🏤谋划`. It is llama.cpp's **terminal**
sampler, in `dist`'s slot, and needs a candidate set top-k and top-p have
already cut down. Moved, it produces `in a magical world called Aylum, a
mysterious dragon slayer`.

`is_greedy()` gained both new knobs in the same commit. **That method has now
been the bug twice** — a knob that changes the output but is not listed there is
accepted, echoed in the header, and silently ignored at temperature 0.
`--mirostat 2` produced byte-identical output to greedy for a whole release
that way.

`--grammar-lazy` takes **substrings, not regexes**, and the help says so.
llama.cpp's `--grammar-lazy-patterns` takes regexes; a half-implemented regex
engine that silently mismatches would arm the grammar at the wrong moment,
which is worse than not having the flag. Verified three ways: a trigger that
fires (`grammar armed after 1 tokens`, then JSON), one that never appears
(prose throughout), and no trigger at all (armed from token 1).

`--infill` resolves the FIM tokens **from the vocabulary's own text** rather
than from metadata keys, because containers disagree about which keys they set
while the token text is stable. Qwen3-4B: 4 tokens found. Qwen2-0.5B: 0, and it
says `0` rather than pretending.

## Every llama.cpp flag is now recognised — 158 implemented, 24 declined

**Updated 2026-08-14, and the previous headline was false.** It read "every
llama.cpp flag is now recognised" while `--flash-attn`/`-fa` was in neither the
implemented set nor the declined one — and an unrecognised flag was not an
error, it became the *prompt*. `chaos-run -m m.gguf -fa off "hello"` ran with
`prompt = "-fa"`, discarded `"hello"`, and exited **0**. The claim was checked by
reading a table; the gap was in the code the table does not describe.

The counts are now **computed from both sources** rather than tallied:

```
llama-completion --help | grep -oE '\-\-[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]*' | sort -u   # 182
```

intersected with `chaos-run`'s match arms and with its `REFUSED` table:

| | count |
|---|---:|
| implemented — the flag changes something observable | **158** |
| declined with a reason — recognised, exits 2, names what is missing | **24** |
| in neither — silently swallowed | **0** |

**That is still not flag parity and must not be quoted as one.** 24 flags do
nothing here, and 15 of them are GPU.

An unknown `-` token is now an error, with `--` as the escape hatch for a prompt
that genuinely starts with a dash. `declined_flags_actually_decline` extracts the
`REFUSED` table from source at test time and runs the binary once per row, so the
table cannot drift from the binary again — it had, silently: `--jinja` sat in the
table claiming "no Jinja engine" while `chaos-jinja` evaluated templates one
match arm above it, and because `REFUSED` is consulted from the *fallback* arm,
the explicit arm shadowed the row. Dead code that lies.

A command line copied from llama.cpp now runs or explains itself, instead of
dying on an unknown flag. What it never does is quietly do less than it says:

```
$ chaos-run -m m.gguf --n-gpu-layers 32
chaos-run: --n-gpu-layers is not supported: no GPU backend exists
  Declined rather than ignored: a run never quietly does less
  than its command line says. Drop the flag to continue.
$ echo $?
2
```

**`-t` was accepted and ignored here for weeks**, and a disconnected knob is
indistinguishable from a flat response — the sweep that "proved threads are not
the lever" was measuring a flag that reached nothing. Refusing out loud is the
cheap defence against repeating that.

What is declined, and the honest reason:

All 24, by group — the counts add up to 24 because they are the table's rows,
not a summary of it:

| n | flags | why |
|---:|---|---|
| 10 | `--device`, `--list-devices`, `--gpu-layers`, `--n-gpu-layers`, `--main-gpu`, `--split-mode`, `--tensor-split`, `--kv-offload`, `--op-offload`, `--override-tensor` | **no GPU backend exists.** `chaos-probe` detects the card and nothing uses it; a VRAM tier needs a CUDA-enabled ggml *and* a non-zero-copy binding path, since weights are bound by handing ggml a host pointer (`weights.rs:286`). Scoped 2026-08-11 in `research/gpu-tier-smallest-honest-slice-2026-08-11.md`: this machine has **no CUDA toolkit at all**, and dense-layers-in-VRAM is a 1.10x ceiling on the model where it fits and doesn't fit on the model where it would matter |
| 4 | `--cache-type-{k,v}-draft`, `--spec-draft-type-{k,v}` | speculative decoding measured ~1.4x here, not the literature's 2.2x, and is a net loss below ~0.75 acceptance |
| 2 | `--grp-attn-n`, `--grp-attn-w` | self-extend, which needs a change to `stream.rs` |
| 2 | `--parallel`, `--defrag-thold` | one sequence by design; an append-only KV cache that cannot fragment |
| 2 | `--poll`, `--poll-batch` | spin-vs-yield inside ggml's threadpool, which ggml owns. Affinity, NUMA-isolate and `--prio` all moved *out* of this row and are implemented — they were one syscall each, and "no affinity layer" described the code rather than the difficulty |
| 2 | `--no-host`, `--no-mmproj` | a host buffer type and a multimodal projector, neither of which exists here |
| 1 | `--backend-sampling` | a GPU concept |
| 1 | `--docker-repo` | a different protocol, not a URL. `-hf`, `--hf-repo` and `--model-url` are implemented |

**`-fa off` is refused too but is not in that table**, because it is a refused
*value* of an implemented flag: one attention path exists and it is the flash
one. It is declined by name rather than accepted, since `-fa off` is a control
`parity-check.sh` passes to the *reference* — ignoring it would silently turn a
parity check into a comparison of a run with itself.

Jinja, reasoning-format, the download flags, affinity and the adapters **left
this table**. The 57 → 24 move is mostly those, not a change of standard: the
adapter flags now load and shape-check a LoRA, though nothing applies it yet, and
that gap is stated where the flag is documented rather than by declining it.

Three more implemented in the same batch: `--mmap` (the default, spelled out),
`--ubatch-size` (takes the smaller of it and `-b`, and says which), and
`--swa-full`, which **is already the behaviour** — Chaos's KV cache is always
full and the window lives in the attention mask, so it reports that rather than
accepting the flag silently.

## `-hf` works: the runner fetches its own models (2026-08-11)

Seven flags moved from **declined** to **implemented**: `-hf`, `--hf-repo`,
`--hf-file`, `--hf-token`, `--model-url`, `--offline`, `--cache-list`. One
command now downloads and runs:

```
$ chaos-run -hf Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/qwen2-0_5b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf \
             -p "The capital of France is" -n 8 --temp 0
model      fetched .../chaos/models/Qwen--Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF--qwen2-0_5b-...gguf
 Paris. It is the most populous city
```

Second run reports `model cached`. `--cache-list` shows it; `--offline` runs
from it and refuses to reach the network.

### Two things that are not "shell out to curl"

**Every download is checked for GGUF's magic number, and a file that fails it
is deleted.** A half-succeeded download is the worst outcome available here: a
truncated container parses far enough to report a plausible architecture and
then fails deep in a forward pass, and a gated repo returns an *HTML error
page* which lands under a `.gguf` name. Leaving that on disk means the next run
re-reads it and misdiagnoses a corrupt model. Four bytes settle it.

**A repo without a filename is refused, not guessed.** `-hf owner/name` and
`owner/name:Q4_K_M` both name a repo holding several quants, and resolving
either needs the Hugging Face listing API, which this build does not call. It
says so, and names both ways out:

```
--hf-repo unsloth/gemma-3-1b-it-GGUF names a repo but not a file. Pass
--hf-file <name.gguf>, or use -hf unsloth/gemma-3-1b-it-GGUF/<name.gguf>.
```

Guessing `<name>-Q4_K_M.gguf` is right for some repos and a 404 for others, and
a 404 saved under a `.gguf` name is exactly the failure above. **This project
has already paid for guessing once**: the pre-tokenizer fallback that guessed
`llama-bpe` where llama.cpp defaults to GPT-2, found today, wrong on every
`gpt2` container that omits the key.

The token is read and **never echoed, including on the failure path** — a
failed download is exactly when output gets pasted into an issue.

Flags recognised: **187** — 137 implemented, 50 declined. Tests **413 -> 420**.

## Both branches merged, and one process rule tightened (2026-08-11)

`main` carries the whole day. Two sessions, no collisions, three branches
deleted after `git merge-base --is-ancestor` confirmed containment.

### The rule that changed, and why it should have been obvious

`starcoder2` was added to `VERIFIED_ARCHITECTURES` on a **3/3 parity pass while
running the wrong pre-tokenizer**. It agreed on those three prompts only
because its merge table differed from the model that failed. Three prompts were
enough to certify an architecture and not enough to notice that its *input* was
being split wrongly.

So `parity-check.sh` runs **eight** prompts now, and its header states what a
pass means: **evidence about these prompts, not about the architecture.** The
five added are a numeric run, a list continuation, arithmetic, SQL and formal
register — each stresses a different part of the vocabulary and a different
part of the graph.

It earned itself immediately: Gemma-3 has an eighth-prompt near-tie
(`Q: What is 17 plus 25? A:`) that three prompts never reached, and Phi-3 has
two. All are reported `unstable` — llama.cpp disagrees with itself on them —
rather than passed or failed.

**A single factual prompt is the weakest test available.** "The capital of
France is Paris" survives a surprising amount of wrong arithmetic, because the
answer is overdetermined by the training data. Both bugs found today —
Gemma's activation and the pre-tokenizer — were caught by the *code* prompt.

### What the merge brought in from the other session

LayerNorm bound beside RMSNorm; the full bias set; **partial RoPE**, where
`rope.dimension_count` had been ignored entirely and `head_dim` went in as
`n_rot` unconditionally, over-rotating every container that declares the key;
ungated FFN; and the pre-tokenizer default. Two traps worth carrying forward:

- **A bias not in `required_tensors` is never loaded, and the graph silently
  skips it.** `output_norm.bias` is the worst case — applied once, so it shifts
  every logit equally and the text stays fluent.
- **A missing `ffn_gate` means two different things.** Phi-3 *fuses* it into a
  tensor twice `n_ff` wide; StarCoder2 has none. Testing for the tensor alone
  made Phi-3 ungated and broke a verified architecture. `ne1 == 2*n_ff`
  separates them.

## `--check-tensors` and `--fit` (2026-08-11) — four more off the declined list

### `--check-tensors`, and the two bugs it found in itself first

Container parsing validates **structure**. All of it can be perfect while the
numbers are ruined, and the symptom is not a crash: the first NaN reaching a
softmax makes every probability NaN, `argmax` returns index 0, and the model
emits one token forever. That reads as a broken *model*, so the search starts in
the forward pass instead of in the file.

Verified by corrupting 4 KiB of a known-good container at a known offset:

```
check      blk.12.ffn_up.weight: non-finite block scale at block 72335
chaos-run: 1 tensor(s) hold non-finite values. This container is damaged
```

The refusal this retracts claimed a values-level scan "would have to dequantise
every tensor". Wrong: the **f16 block scales** are floats, need no
dequantisation, and are exactly where a ruined quantise shows up.

Two bugs, both caught only by running it against a container **known to be
healthy**:

1. **Q4_K and Q5_K carry their scales at the start of the block, not the tail.**
   Packed 4-bit quants at offset 140 read as `inf`, so the validator called a
   healthy Qwen2 container damaged. Worse: **the unit test asserted the tail
   too** — written from the same assumption as the code, so it proved only that
   the two agreed. Both now cite `ggml-common.h`.
2. **The 8 MiB chunk was not a multiple of 144 or 210 bytes**, so every chunk
   after the first began mid-block. It failed at `token_embd.weight` "block
   246754" — exactly where chunk one ended.

An unknown quant type is **counted as uninspectable, never guessed at**: reading
the wrong two bytes as a scale invents failures, and a validator that cries wolf
is worse than none.

### `--fit`, `--fit-target`, `--fit-ctx`

The one flag group where Chaos should be *ahead* rather than level: llama.cpp
asks "will this fit in device memory" from outside the engine, and owning
residency is this project's whole design.

| | effect, measured |
|---|---|
| default (`--fit on`, target 1024 MiB) | 7.46 GiB expert cache |
| `--fit-target 6144` | **2.44 GiB** — the headroom moved and the cache gave way |
| `--fit off` | fixed 1.00 GiB, machine-independent |
| `--cache 3` + `--fit-target 6144` | **3.00 GiB** — an explicit argument still wins |

`--fit` only ever adjusts arguments the user did **not** set, which is what
makes llama.cpp's default-on safe to match. `--fit off` gives a fixed 1 GiB
rather than everything free, because the point of turning fitting off is
reproducibility and "all of RAM" is the least reproducible number available.

The 2 GiB headroom this file hardcoded is now `--fit-target`, and the header
prints which value it used — **a headroom you cannot see is a headroom you
cannot argue with.**

`--fit-ctx` reports the question this project exists to answer: *given this
machine, how much context is there room for?* Its first version answered "0
tokens" on a machine with 8 GiB free, because it subtracted the expert cache —
which is by construction everything left after headroom. **The cache is elastic
and the KV cache is not**, so the honest answer is what fits once the cache has
shrunk to its floor: 568,519 tokens for Qwen2-0.5B.

Flags: **140 implemented, 47 declined**, of 187 recognised.

## CPU affinity: six more off the declined list, and the mask reaches the metal

`--cpu-mask`, `--cpu-range`, `--cpu-strict` and their three `-batch` variants.
The proof they work is not that they parse:

```
--cpu-mask 0xf      prefill 151 tokens in 1.2s (122.85 tok/s)
--cpu-mask 0xfffff  prefill 151 tokens in 0.5s (303.19 tok/s)
```

**2.5x from the mask alone** — the flag reaches the hardware, which is exactly
what `-t` failed to do for weeks while being accepted and echoed.

I refused these earlier for "no thread-affinity layer". **That premise was
wrong in the same way `--prio`'s and `--warmup`'s were**: process affinity is
one syscall, and every thread ggml spawns inherits it. Chaos does not need to
own a threadpool to pin one. Three refusals in a row have now turned out to
rest on a wrong premise rather than a real limit — the pattern is refusing on
*architecture* ("we have no X layer") when the flag only needs a *syscall*.

What it genuinely cannot do is a different mask for prefill and generation,
since ggml owns the pool. The `-batch` variants share the mask and the runner
says so, rather than taking a second one and dropping it.

### Two things the tests caught before the hardware did

**`5` means different CPUs to the two flags.** It is CPUs 0 and 2 as a hex
mask and CPU 5 as a range — which is *why* llama.cpp carries two flags. My one
heuristic parser guessed hex and would have pinned `--cpu-range 5` to two cores
instead of one, silently. Split into `parse_cpu_mask` and `parse_cpu_range`.

**`--cpu-strict` capped generation threads and not prefill**, so a 4-CPU mask
still ran 20 prefill threads. Oversubscription is the thing strict mode exists
to prevent, and half-applying it is worse than not offering it — the header
then reads as though it worked. Both counts now follow the mask, and an
explicit `-t`/`-tb` still wins over both.

Flags: **147 implemented, 44 declined**, of 191 recognised. Tests **435**.

## Context shift: generation past the context limit (2026-08-11)

`--context-shift` (default on), `--no-context-shift`, `--keep N`. 40 tokens
generated under a 24-token limit:

```
$ chaos-run -m m.gguf -p "Once upon a time" -n 40 -c 24 --keep 4
shift      context full: kept 4, dropped 9. ...
generated  40 tokens in 1.6s (25.10 tok/s)
```

**The shift was unreachable when first written.** The `-c` check refused the
run before generation started — the exact case the shift exists to handle — so
the flag fired zero times while being accepted and echoed. That check is now
gated on `--no-context-shift`, and its message names the way forward instead of
just the wall.

### The limitation is stated at runtime, not buried

```
The shifted keys still carry the rotation of their ORIGINAL positions --
llama.cpp re-ropes them and this build does not, so history past the first
shift is approximate. --no-context-shift stops instead.
```

A key is computed with RoPE applied at its absolute position. After the slide it
sits at a lower one, so every shifted key carries a rotation for a position it
no longer occupies. llama.cpp corrects this (`llama_kv_cache_seq_add`); this
does not. The output degrades visibly after a shift, and **saying so once, in
the run itself, is the difference between a documented approximation and a
silent one.** It is still better than refusing to generate, and it is the trade
llama.cpp made before it added re-roping.

`KvCache::shift_out` carries three unit tests, including one that checks a
slid position holds what the *later* position held rather than what used to be
in that slot — the failure mode that would look like plausible text.

Flags: **150 implemented, 44 declined**, of 194 recognised. Tests **438**.

## `unstable` was a verdict; it is a suspicion now (2026-08-11)

The parity harness re-ran the reference under `-fa off` and `--no-repack` and,
when llama.cpp disagreed with itself, called the prompt a near-tie and moved on.
**Nine of eleven `unstable` verdicts in one session turned out to be bugs** —
Llama-3.2 rotating with the wrong RoPE, Falcon3 prefilled a token short.

The flaw is structural, not a threshold: **that re-check compares the reference
to itself, and cannot see that OUR INPUT differed.** When the input differs, a
near-tie is exactly the symptom — the model is answering a slightly different
question and lands on the other side of whatever was close.

Two changes:

1. **On a mismatch, the tokenized prompt is compared.** Different token counts
   mean the two engines are not answering the same question, and it is reported
   as a **FAILURE** rather than a tie. One check catches the whole class: a
   missing BOS, a wrong pre-tokenizer, a byte-fallback that drops characters.
2. **Near-ties are counted, and three is a cluster.** One in eight is ordinary;
   three is a bug nobody has found yet, and the script exits non-zero saying so
   rather than printing eight reassuring lines.

Phi-3's two survive both checks — identical tokenization, below the cluster
threshold — which is the answer the harness should have been giving all along.

## Reasoning blocks: six more off the declined list (2026-08-11)

`--reasoning-format`, `--reasoning`, `--reasoning-budget`,
`--reasoning-budget-message`, `--reasoning-preserve`,
`--no-reasoning-preserve`. On Qwen3-4B, which thinks:

```
default                     <think>Okay, the user is asking...</think> 2 + 2 = 4
--reasoning-format auto     2 + 2 = 4
--reasoning-budget 20       reasoning  budget of 20 tokens reached while
                                       still inside <think>; stopping
```

**Refused earlier as "downstream of Jinja".** That was wrong for the fourth
time in the same shape: the block is delimited by ordinary text in the output,
and finding it needs no template engine at all. The pattern in every one of
these — `--prio`, `--warmup`, the affinity group, and now this — is refusing on
*architecture* ("we have no X layer") when the feature only needs to read what
is already there.

Two decisions worth recording:

**The tags are matched as text, not as token ids.** Qwen3 emits `<`, `think`,
`>` as three tokens, and the tags are ordinary vocabulary in most models.
Matching ids would have worked on one model and failed silently on the next —
which is this project's signature failure.

**Hitting the budget stops rather than forcing `</think>`.** Injecting a close
tag means guessing a token id that differs per vocabulary, and a model still
thinking at its budget has not produced an answer — cutting mid-thought and
continuing would read as one. `--reasoning-budget-message` prints in its place
so the truncation is visible as truncation.

Flags: **156 implemented, 38 declined**, of 194 recognised.

## `--load-mode` and `--numa isolate` (2026-08-11) — the fifth and sixth wrong premise

```
--load-mode dio          model qwen2 (direct (cache bypassed))
--load-mode mmap         model qwen2 (buffered (page cache in use))
--load-mode mmap+mlock   ... mlock 0.34 GiB pinned in physical memory
--numa distribute        refused BY NAME, with what it would need
```

**`--load-mode` was refused for "`--direct-io`/`--no-direct-io` are the two
modes that exist".** llama.cpp now marks `--mlock`, `--mmap` and `--direct-io`
all *deprecated in favour of* `--load-mode`, and every one of its five modes
maps onto a switch this build already had. The modes existed; the spelling did
not. `mmap+mlock` is one mode, not two flags — that is the part a naive alias
would have got wrong.

**`--numa` was refused for "no NUMA-aware allocation to select between".** Half
right, and the half that matters was wrong: `isolate` is a mask and a syscall,
exactly like the affinity group. `distribute` and `numactl` place *individual
threads* on chosen nodes and ggml owns the pool, so those two are refused **by
name** with what they would need, rather than the whole flag being declined.

On a single-node machine `isolate` reports that there is nothing to isolate.
Silently pinning to "the whole machine" would have looked like it worked.

**Six refusals in a row have now turned out to rest on a wrong premise** —
`--prio`, `--warmup`, the affinity group, the reasoning group, `--load-mode`,
`--numa`. The question that produced all six was "do we have a subsystem named
after this?". The right one is "what does this actually require?".

Flags: **158 implemented, 36 declined**, of 194 recognised.

## `rope_freqs.weight` is ignored — every Llama-3.x model is wrong (2026-08-11)

The eight-prompt sweep found it. Llama-3.2-1B:

```
FAIL  SELECT name, COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE
  chaos   :  age > 18 AND gender = 'male' GROUP BY name;
  llama.cpp:  age > 18 GROUP BY name HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

llama.cpp is **stable** on that prompt across `-fa on`, `-fa off`,
`--no-repack` and `-t 4`, so it is not a near-tie.

Llama-3.x containers ship a `rope_freqs.weight` tensor and llama.cpp passes it
to `ggml_rope_ext` as `freq_factors`. **This build passes `None` at all four
call sites** — and the parameter is already there as an `Option`, so nothing
was missing except the value.

**`llama` has been in `VERIFIED_ARCHITECTURES` since the beginning**, and
TinyLlama passes 8/8 — because TinyLlama is Llama-2 and has no such tensor. One
container in a family exercising a feature and another not is exactly the gap a
three-prompt set leaves. Read `llama` as "verified on Llama-2-shaped
containers" until this lands.

Ticket: `docs/graph/backlog/rope-freqs-ignored.md`. The fix is three lines in
`qwen3.rs`/`stream.rs`, which the other session owns.

### The harness also cried wolf once, and that is worth as much

TinyLlama reported a FAIL on `Q: What is 17 plus 25? A:` where both engines
answered ` 42`. llama.cpp prints `[end of text]` on EOS and Chaos stops
silently — **the generated tokens were identical.** Stripped now.

A harness that cries wolf is worse than no harness: the first thing anyone does
with a FAIL is go looking in the forward pass. Two FAILs appeared in this sweep
and exactly one was real; without checking both, the real one would have been
dismissed along with the false one.

## The eight-prompt sweep, re-run after the harness fix (2026-08-11)

| container | ok | unstable | FAIL |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| tinyllama-1.1b-chat | 8 | 0 | 0 |
| Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct | 8 | 0 | 0 |
| gemma-2-2b-it | 8 | 0 | 0 |
| gemma-3-1b-it | 8 | 0 | 0 |
| Qwen3-4B | 8 | 0 | 0 |
| Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct | 6 | 2 | 0 |
| **Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct** | 3 | 4 | **1** |

**Gemma-3's arithmetic prompt and Gemma-2's are no longer unstable.** Both were
the `[end of text]` artefact, not near-ties — the harness had been comparing
llama.cpp's EOS marker against our silence. Five containers are now clean at
eight prompts where three prompts had certified them.

**Phi-3's two unstable prompts survive the harness fix**, which settles what
they are: llama.cpp genuinely disagrees with itself on them under `--no-repack`.
Gemma's did not survive it, so the two cases are different and only one was ever
about the models.

Llama-3.2 is the outlier twice over: the only FAIL (`rope_freqs.weight`,
ticketed) and the only container with four genuine near-ties in eight.

## The Jinja gap, scoped rather than guessed at (2026-08-11)

`--jinja` is the last CLI capability that is not GPU, not a draft model and not
an adapter. It has stayed unbuilt because of the rule in `chat.rs`: **a
half-implemented Jinja silently produces the wrong framing.**

Censusing all 12 `tokenizer.chat_template`s on disk makes the subset bounded:

```
if/endif 123 · set 98 · else 40 · for/endfor 31 · elif 21
loop.index0 20 · loop.last 12 · loop.first 10
namespace() 10 · raise_exception() 6 · strftime_now() 1
filters: tojson 15, trim 6, length 5
operators: in, not, is defined, is string, is not none
```

**No macros, no imports, no inheritance, three filters.** That is a
self-contained crate with no dependencies, the same shape as `chaos-grammar`
— a weekend, not a quarter.

The acceptance test already exists: `chat-templates.txt` is llama.cpp's own
rendering of all 54 templates, and 52 of the family renderers are verified
against it. A Jinja engine agreeing with them is a **cross-check between two
independent implementations**, not a self-check.

Ticket: `docs/graph/backlog/jinja-chat-templates.md`.

## `-b 1` joins the no-op probe, and why that is a cost as well as a fix

The other session asked for it and the principle holds: batching changes how
many tokens a forward pass covers, which for a correct engine only reorders
sums. llama.cpp disagrees with **itself** under it, verified here on
Qwen3-30B-A3B:

```
default : ...Spain is Madrid. The capital of Germany is Berlin.
-b 1    : ...Spain is Madrid. The capital of Portugal is Lisbon.
```

**The set of no-op configurations tested decides what counts as a bug**, and
that cuts both ways. Every configuration added makes `unstable` easier to reach,
and `unstable` is exactly where a real bug hides — Llama-3.2 reported **four**
unstable prompts for a day and all four turned out to be `rope_freqs.weight`
being ignored. The cluster was the signal, not the noise.

So the harness now **names which configuration moved it**:

```
unstable  Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct  The capital of France is
  the reference disagrees with itself under: -fa-off --no-repack -b-1
```

"`-b 1` only" is a weaker claim than "every no-op moves it", and collapsing the
two into one word is how a cluster stops looking like a cluster. The rule that
three or more unstable in eight exits non-zero is what keeps the addition
honest.

One correction back to that session: their report says `-b 1` reproduces **both**
Phi-3 near-ties byte-identically against Chaos. Re-run here, only the
arithmetic prompt does; `The capital of France is` gives `Paris. Paris is known
for its rich history` under `-b 1` against Chaos's `Paris. <|assistant|> That's
correct!`. The classification is unchanged — the reference is unstable there
under all three configurations — but the stated reason was not reproducible.

## `--jinja` is wired, and the fallback is the feature (2026-08-13)

The container's own template is evaluated when asked, and **declines loudly** on
anything the engine does not fully understand:

```
$ chaos-run -m Qwen2-0.5B --jinja -sys SYS -p HI
chat       template evaluated (--jinja)
prompt     "<|im_start|>system
SYS<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
HI<|im_end|>
..."

$ chaos-run -m Llama-3.2-1B --jinja -sys SYS -p HI
prompt     "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>


            Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 13 Aug 2026

SYS..."

$ chaos-run -m Phi-3-mini --jinja -sys SYS -p HI
chat       template has no system branch; merging it into the first user turn
chat       template evaluated (--jinja)

$ chaos-run -m gemma-2-2b-it --jinja -sys SYS -p HI
chat       --jinja declined: template rejected this conversation: System role not supported
           falling back to the family matcher.
```

**Off by default, unlike llama.cpp.** The family renderers are verified
byte-identical to llama.cpp's for 52 of its 54 names; making evaluation the
default would change the prompt on models that are currently verified. That is
a thing to opt into.

Every decline names the construct. A fallback nobody can see is
indistinguishable from a flag that does nothing — which is the failure `-t`
already cost this project once.

Gemma-2's decline is worth its own note: its template **raises** on a system
turn, and falling back means the family matcher then accepts a conversation the
model's own template forbids. The fallback is still the safe move; the family
matcher's permissiveness is the open question.

Flags: **165 implemented, 30 declined**, of 195 recognised. Tests **481**.

## Jinja: every template on disk renders (2026-08-13)

**15 containers: 6 agree with the family matcher, 8 differ, 1 refuses** — and
the refusal is Gemma-2's template *correctly* raising on a system turn.

Our rendering is **byte-identical to `llama-completion --jinja`** on Llama-3.2,
date included. Two fixes got the last four tokens:

- **`strftime_now`, and treating a built-in as `is defined`.** Llama-3 guards
  with `if strftime_now is defined` and falls back to a hardcoded
  `26 Jul 2024` — so answering `false` put a two-year-stale date in every
  Llama-3 prompt.
- **Jinja strips one trailing newline** (`keep_trailing_newline=False`), which
  Llama-3's template depends on.

The 8 "differ" rows are **not failures**: llama.cpp behaves identically, its
`--no-jinja` matching our family matcher and its `--jinja` matching our engine.
Hardcoded renderers drop content the templates specify — a property of the
approach, not a bug in either engine.

One judgement reversed: `'' + true` was refused on the principle that silent
coercion is how a template prints `None`. llama.cpp evaluates with **minja,
which coerces**, and DeepSeek writes exactly that. The line is now **a defined
scalar coerces, `none` still refuses** — the dangerous case was never `true`,
it was a missing variable becoming the literal text `None`.

## Adapters: loaded and checked, applied nowhere (2026-08-13)

`--lora`, `--lora-scaled`, `--control-vector`, `--control-vector-scaled`,
`--control-vector-layer-range`. `chaos-model/src/adapter.rs`, 8 unit tests.

**The loader is deliberately separate from the application.** Applying either is
a change to the forward pass; deciding whether an adapter *belongs to this
model* is arithmetic on shapes — and that is where the silent failures are:

- A LoRA whose `lora_a` is stored untransposed **still multiplies**, against the
  wrong axis, and gives a model that answers fluently and is not the fine-tune.
  llama.cpp calls this one out by name and so does the error here.
- **The scale is `alpha / rank`, not `alpha`.** A rank-64 adapter with alpha 16
  scales by 0.25; using alpha alone applies it 4x too strongly — which does not
  error, and produces a model that *is* recognisably the fine-tune and wrong in
  degree. The hardest kind of wrong to notice.
- A control vector for a 32-layer model applied to a 26-layer one shifts the
  wrong residuals. `--control-vector-layer-range` **clears** out-of-range
  layers rather than clamping, because clamping would apply a direction to a
  layer the user excluded.

**The run is refused, not warned.** A run that loaded an adapter and did not
apply it would produce base-model output under a command line asking for a
fine-tune, and nothing downstream could tell:

```
$ chaos-run -m model.gguf --lora adapter.gguf
chaos-run: adapters are checked but NOT YET APPLIED -- the forward-pass half is
unimplemented, so this run would give you base-model output. Drop the adapter
flags to continue.
```

Flags: **170 implemented, 25 declined**, of 195 recognised. Tests **492**.

## RWKV: the fifth tokenizer family (2026-08-13)

llama.cpp has five real vocabulary types — SPM, BPE, WPM, UGM, RWKV. This had
four. `crates/chaos-tokenizer/src/rwkv.rs`, 8 unit tests plus 6 through the
public `from_metadata` path.

It is **greedy longest match over a trie of raw byte strings**: no merge table,
no scores, no pre-tokenizer. Two details are easy to get subtly wrong and
neither raises:

- **The vocabulary is stored escaped.** `\n`, `\t` and `\xNN` appear as literal
  backslash sequences, so a loader that keeps the stored text builds a trie
  keyed on the *text of the escape*. A real newline then never matches, and
  every line break becomes an unknown token. Decoding has the inverse problem —
  emitting the stored text puts a literal backslash-n where the model produced
  a newline. Both directions are tested.
- **Longest match is the last node *with a value*, not the deepest reached.**
  With `ab` and `abcd` present and `abc` absent, the walk descends past the
  answer; taking the deepest node would emit nothing at all.

`\xNN` can denote a byte that is not valid UTF-8 alone, which is why the
unescape works in bytes rather than `char`s. An empty vocabulary entry is
skipped at build time — it matches at every position with length zero, so the
loop would hang on real input rather than merely answer wrongly.

**Implemented is not verified**, and the parity row says so. There is no RWKV
container on this machine, so the family is exercised against a hand-built
vocabulary through the real loading path — not against llama.cpp. This project
has already shipped `gemma2` as "verified" while it ran the wrong activation.
Loading is not evidence, and neither is a test I wrote myself.

Tests **492 → 507**.

## Known limitations

> **Four of the five entries below are FIXED and are kept only as the record.**
> What is actually limiting today, as of 2026-08-16:
>
> - **The GPU tier is not verified.** `--device`, `-ngl`, `-ot` and
>   `--op-offload` all work, on Vulkan only. The device path fails 1 of 8 parity
>   prompts where the CPU path fails none — arithmetic rather than wiring, but
>   unproven either way, and it must not be called finished.
> - **13 architectures of llama.cpp's 141**, and `qwen3moe` is deliberately not
>   on the verified list.
> - **20 tok/s on V4-Flash is not reachable** and this is a measurement, not a
>   backlog item: it needs 79 MB/token and the model reads 3288.
> - **One pass is capped at 897 tokens** on the V4-Flash path; chunking satisfies
>   longer prompts, and the 256-token *context* cap is gone.
> - **macOS falls back to buffered I/O** — `F_NOCACHE` is not wired up — and no
>   model has been run on macOS or Linux, only built and tested there.

- ~~**V4-Flash is capped at 256 tokens of context. Confirmed 2026-08-08.**~~
  **FIXED 2026-08-11 (R12, #46)** — the raw latents live in a 1024-slot ring now.
  Original entry:
  `attention()` builds one F16 cache of `kv_lora_rank * N_KV` = 512 × 256 and
  indexes it by absolute position. A 388-token prompt used to read weights for
  eight seconds and then panic with `range end index 198656 out of range for
  slice of length 131072` — 512 × 388 against 512 × 256. It now **refuses before
  reading anything**, with the limit and the reason. Every V4-Flash measurement
  this project has published is 5–198 tokens, which is why nothing caught it.
  The long-context prefill figures in the docs are Qwen3, a different path.
  **Lifting this is part of R3.**
- ~~**No KV cache on the V4-Flash path**~~ **FIXED (R3)** — one cache per
  session; the prompt fills it and each token appends a row. Original entry:
  every generated token re-runs prefill
  over the whole sequence. The 0.015–0.064 tok/s generation figures are an
  artefact of that, not a measure of the engine. **A single-token pass costs
  3.0s** (re-measured 2026-08-08 with the whole always-read set resident), so a
  cached step is worth **~0.33 tok/s against llama.cpp's 0.21–0.31** — R3 alone
  turns a 3–4x deficit into a slight lead.
- ~~**No GPU support** anywhere in the compute path.~~ **FIXED 2026-08-15/16** —
  `--device`, `-ngl`, `-ot`, `--op-offload` and `ggml_backend_sched`, on Vulkan.
  Not verified, and **4.3x slower on a streaming MoE model**, which is the one
  this project exists for.
- ~~**No installer.**~~ **FIXED 2026-08-16** — `scripts/install.ps1` installs and
  upgrades in place on Windows, is shipped inside the archive, and is
  smoke-tested in the release workflow on the unpacked archive. Original entry:
  building needs the GNU Rust toolchain, MSYS2 and a
  hand-built ggml. There are no prebuilt binaries and no model downloader.
  **Windows binaries are now redistributable** (2026-08-08) — the GNU C++ and
  OpenMP runtimes link statically, so the `.exe` needs only system DLLs. Before
  that it died with `0xC0000135` before `main` on any machine without MSYS2,
  silently. **The release workflow is written** (2026-08-09, `release.yml`): it
  builds on a tag for all three platforms, **asserts every binary actually
  starts** — a missing runtime kills the process before `main`, so silence is the
  symptom — reports what each links against, and attaches the archives. Not yet
  fired against a real tag.

## Things that are true and cost time to rediscover

The full list is [`docs/graph/reference/hard-won-facts.md`](docs/graph/reference/hard-won-facts.md),
38 entries; `CLAUDE.md` carries a one-line summary of each. The three that have
burned the most time:

- **A wrong tokenizer or forward pass produces fluent nonsense, never a crash.**
  Test pieces separately, against an oracle.
- **ggml aborts on arena exhaustion** — no error to catch. Size arenas up front,
  and scale every one of them with the prefill block.
- **Cache hit rate is not a success metric.** Past ~6 GiB on Qwen3 a 71%-hit
  cache was the *slowest* configuration measured, because cached bytes got paged
  out and a "hit" became a page fault in disguise. Only tok/s at a stated
  footprint counts.

And the process rule this project has paid for twice: **a competitive claim is
not citable until the competitor's exact command line and its output are in a
doc, run in the same session as the number it is compared against.**

## How to resume

```bash
# ggml must be built first
export GGML_LIB_DIR=C:/Projects/llamacpp-unsloth/build/ggml/src
cargo test --release          # 168 tests (+16 container-backed, --ignored)
cargo build --release
./target/release/chaos-probe        # RAM/disk/GPU + what to close
```

Windows needs the **GNU** Rust toolchain and `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin` on PATH —
Git Bash's own `/mingw64` is not MSYS2's and has no `gcc`, which shows up as
`cannot find -lgomp` at link time.

**Toolchain fix, 2026-08-10**: MSYS2 updated to gcc 16.1.0 and its `libmingwex`
dropped `_gnu_exception_handler`, `__mingw_oldexcpt_handler` and the
`__mingw_initlts*` symbols that rustup's bundled `crt2.o` still references. Every
link began failing with "undefined reference" on code that compiles cleanly.
`.cargo/config.toml` now sets `link-self-contained=no` for
`x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`, so rustc uses MSYS2's startup files, which match MSYS2's
libraries. Scoped to that target; MSVC, Linux and macOS are untouched.

Models are at `C:\Projects\models\` (v4flash 144 GB / 5 shards, qwen3moe 17.28
GiB, qwen3-4b 2.33 GB). **Do not download more without asking** — limited home
internet.

## Hardware this is measured on

15.7 GiB RAM (typically 3–10 GiB free), i7-13650HX (20 logical cores), NVMe at
**2.74 GiB/s** measured (`chaos-iobench`, 4 MiB scattered slices, one handle per
reader — it reaches that at *four* handles and does not climb at 8, 16 or 32),
RTX 3050 6 GB laptop.

**The GPU is used**, and the sentence that stood here — *"no GPU code exists"* —
has been false since 2026-08-15. `--device`, `-ngl`, `-ot`, `--op-offload` and
`ggml_backend_sched` are all bound, on Vulkan. What is true is that **the device
path is not verified**: it fails 1 of 8 parity prompts where the CPU path fails
none, and that is arithmetic rather than wiring — the kernels disagree by
0.37–0.71 while the model's own top-2 margin falls to 0.399. See
`research/ngl-partial-offload-2026-08-16.md`.

## Working rules

- Implementation goes on `ticket/<name>` branches + PR. **Claude owns git end to
  end**: merge when CI is green, close what it supersedes, delete the branch, and
  leave `main` verified. Docs may go to `main`.
- Push with the token from `C:\Projects\.env` inline in the URL, output redacted.
  Never in git config, never echoed. Model files stay gitignored.
- Graph docs live in `docs/graph/`; read `INDEX.md`, then only the 2–3 nodes a
  task links to. Any node change updates its INDEX line in the same commit.

## R10.1 — constrained decoding: GBNF and JSON schema (2026-08-11)

`crates/chaos-grammar` (new, **no dependencies at all** — not ggml, not even
the tokenizer) parses GBNF, compiles it to a stack matcher, and turns the bytes
generated so far into the token ids that may legally come next. Detail:
`docs/graph/research/gbnf-grammars-2026-08-11.md`.

Unlocks 4 of the 182 flags: `--grammar`, `--grammar-file`, `--json-schema`,
`--json-schema-file`. **The library is done; the CLI wiring is not** —
`sample.rs` and `chaos-run.rs` belong to another session, so the hook stops at
one function:

```rust
constraint.allowed(generated_so_far).apply(&mut logits);
```

**Verified against llama.cpp, not against expectations.** A grammar that accepts
everything passes any test that only checks acceptance, so the accepted text is
llama.cpp's own output under the same grammar at `--temp 0`, and every case
also checks a rejection that is a one-character edit of it.

| grammar | llama.cpp's output | ours |
|---|---|---|
| `json.gbnf` | `{"name":"John","age":30,...}` | accepted, complete |
| `--json-schema` person | `{"name":"John","age":30}` | accepted, complete |
| `--json-schema` array | `{"city": "New York", "scores": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] }` | accepted, complete |

Two bugs, one found by a unit test and one only findable this way:

1. **Only the first alternative of the root rule was explored.** A rule is
   entered through a `RuleRef`, which fans out over alternatives; the root has
   none pointing at it. `root ::= "cat" | "car"` took `cat` and refused `car`.
2. **Three of the eight grammars llama.cpp ships did not parse.** `json.gbnf`,
   `json_arr.gbnf` and `c.gbnf` put the rule body on the line after `::=`.
   A test that walks the whole `grammars/` directory found it on its first run.

Everything unimplemented is **refused by name, never ignored** — token literals
(`<think>`), `allOf`, `pattern`, `minimum`, `additionalProperties: true` and the
rest. Ignoring a schema keyword yields a grammar *looser* than asked for, so the
model emits output that satisfies the grammar and violates the schema, and
nothing downstream can tell.

66 tests here; 255 pass in the ggml-free CI job, which now includes this crate.

## R2 — reads now overlap compute: 1.13x on generation (2026-08-11)

**Supersedes the `R2 | overlap I/O with compute | ready, but smaller than it
looks` row in the table above.** Built, measured, and **on by default**. Detail:
`docs/graph/research/r2-overlap-2026-08-11.md`.

Block N+1's always-read weights are read **while block N computes**. Exact, not
speculative: routing is data-dependent so N+1's *experts* cannot be known before
N runs, but its **dense** tensors do not depend on routing at all.

Four runs, one session, **free RAM matched to within 0.03 GiB** — the axis these
figures drift along — with 3.10 GiB of the always-read set still streaming:

| | free | prefill | generation | dense read | expert read |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| overlap off | 7.10 GiB | 0.56 tok/s | 0.280 tok/s | **2.15 s** | 7.01 s |
| overlap on | 7.13 | **0.60** | **0.316** | **0.02 s** | 8.13 s |
| on, repeat | 7.11 | **0.60** | **0.317** | 0.02 s | 8.21 s |

**1.07x prefill, 1.13x generation**, reproducible to the third decimal.

**The dense read is now free — 2.15 s to 0.02 s across 86 block-passes — and the
expert reads gave 1.16 s of it back.** That is why this is a third of the ~1.4x
ceiling rather than all of it, and the reason is measured rather than guessed:

| prefetch readers | dense | expert |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 (off) | 2.56 s | 7.02 s |
| 2 | 0.02 s | 8.39 s |
| 4 | 0.04 s | 8.43 s |

Two handles hide the dense read as completely as four, and four cost the experts
no more than two — so **the toll is the drive, not the pool split.** Both sets of
reads compete for the same bandwidth, and moving bytes off the critical path
does not make them free. This is `the-plateau-was-ours` read from the other side:
there the ceiling was ours, here the drive is genuinely the limit.

Two things that had to be right first:

- **`read_range_into_via` requires distinct slots**, and `read_expert_slices`
  already used all eight handles. A prefetch started naively would have
  reintroduced by hand the queue-depth-1 bug whose fix was worth 1.32x — and it
  would have shown up as "overlap does not help", not as an error. The pool is
  partitioned: foreground `0..6`, prefetch `6..8`.
- **With residency satisfied the overlap is off, not merely idle.** Shrinking the
  foreground pool to feed a thread that reads nothing is a pure loss, so the
  decision is made once per pass from whether block 1 has a non-resident tensor.

All 21 container-backed V4-Flash tests pass with it active, including the
element-sum comparisons against llama.cpp — the overlap changes *when* bytes are
read, never which. `CHAOS_PREFETCH_OVERLAP=0` disables it;
`CHAOS_PREFETCH_READERS` tunes the split.

## The release workflow had two bugs, and only a real tag could find them (2026-08-16)

`release.yml` had never been fired against a tag. It was written, it asserted
that every binary starts, and `STATUS.md` carried *"not yet fired against a real
tag"* as a known unknown. Both failures were in the same final step, and in both
the three platform builds and the installer smoke test passed first — so the
archives were built correctly and then thrown away.

1. **`gh release upload` requires a release, and a tag push does not create
   one.** `release not found`, exit 1. Fixed by creating it when missing, with
   `--verify-tag` so it cannot invent a tag.
2. **`gh` refuses `--notes-from-tag` alongside `--repo`.** `--repo` was there
   because the job checks nothing out. Fixed by checking out at `fetch-depth: 0`
   — which is also what brings the tag the notes come from — and dropping
   `--repo` from every `gh` call in the job.

**A workflow that has never run is not a workflow that works**, and neither bug
is visible by reading: both are about a command's behaviour rather than the
YAML. The step now prints what it attached, with sizes, so a future silent
success is at least a checkable one.

## Running it no longer starts with a path (2026-08-16)

`chaos-run <name>` resolves any unique part of a model's name against
`CHAOS_MODELS`, `~/.chaos/models`, the download cache and `./models`. Bare
`chaos-run` lists what is on the machine. An existing path still wins, so no
previous invocation changes; an ambiguous name lists the candidates rather than
guessing a 144 GB read; an unknown one lists what is available.

**This closed a gap nobody had noticed was two gaps.** `install.ps1` created
`~/.chaos/models` for hand-dropped files and `chaos-pull` wrote to a platform
cache directory, and nothing searched both — so where a model lived depended on
how it had arrived. The lookup searches both, and `chaos-serve` uses the same
code so the two binaries cannot drift apart on it.

The banner also changed shape: **the name first, the logo centred beneath it**,
and the logo cropped to the artwork rather than the SVG's canvas, which had been
carrying a wide white margin into every render.

## Clone-to-run, checked before the release (2026-08-16)

**23 s from `git clone` to twelve binaries; 566 tests, 0 failed.** Run from a
fresh clone of `main`, not from a working tree. Full transcript:
`research/from-zero-2026-08-16.md`.

A fresh machine needs Rust 1.82+ (the **GNU** toolchain on Windows), MSYS2 with
`mingw64/bin` on PATH **to build and not to run**, one ggml build for the CPU
path and a **second** with `-DGGML_VULKAN=ON` for anything touching the device.
Nothing else, and no network after the clone.

**Two things surprise a first-time user, and only one was a bug.**

1. **`--auto` read 1.63 tok/s against 6.85 with no flags** on a machine that had
   never run the binary — and that was nearly recorded as `--auto` being
   catastrophically wrong. It is ggml's Vulkan backend compiling its shader set
   inside the timed region. Alternating four pairs warm: **9.20 / 9.63 / 9.00 /
   9.46 against 7.57 / 7.84 / 7.47 / 7.24 — `--auto` is 1.23x ahead, four of
   four.** `CLAUDE.md`'s "discard the first run" is what caught it. **It is still
   a real user experience**: the first run after an install is slow, once, and
   nothing says why. Not yet fixed.
2. **The demo model refuses to run.** `qwen3moe` is deliberately off
   `VERIFIED_ARCHITECTURES`, so Qwen3-30B-A3B needs `--force`. Correct, and now
   documented rather than discovered.

**One fix shipped from it**: the expert-cache line printed on dense models too —
`cache 8.41 GiB for experts` under a 2.3 GiB model that has none — which is the
first line `--auto` shows and reads like a memory bug. Gated on the model
actually having routed experts.

## V4-Flash is at parity with llama.cpp, and the old deficit is retracted (2026-08-16)

**Supersedes the "V4-Flash prefill 1.62x behind, generation 3-4x behind" rows
below and in the README**, which had stood for nine days. Both engines
alternating in one session, warm-to-warm, three pairs after a discarded warm-up,
10.3 GiB free:

| DeepSeek-V4-Flash | Chaos | llama.cpp | verdict |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| prefill, ms per prompt token | **1640** | 1679 | **parity** |
| generation, tok/s | **0.394** | 0.39 | **parity** |

Per prompt token is the only fair prefill comparison: the prompt is 5 tokens for
us and 7 for llama.cpp.

**The warm-up is why this says parity and not a lead.** llama.cpp's discarded
first run read **0.23 tok/s** — against 0.392 that is a 1.7x lead and would have
been a fourth wrong published figure. Its first run generates two tokens and pays
first-token cost across both; by the third it is at 0.39, and nothing in its
output says "this one is cold".

**llama.cpp was not left on a bad setting.** It defaults to 10 threads here and
`CLAUDE.md` records it peaking at 4 on Qwen3-30B, so a `-t 4` arm was started —
and abandoned: one 3-token run produced nothing after **417 s of wall clock for
50 s of CPU**, CPU time flat over the last 126 s of it, against ~50 s wall at the
default. On a model that streams, threads are an I/O concurrency knob rather than
a compute one. Reported as an observation, not a ratio, because it never
finished.

## V4-Flash measured, and the parallel-experts port is dead (2026-08-16)

**The flagship model now has a baseline taken with repeats rather than
remembered.** Three alternating rounds, one session, greedy:

| | run 1 | run 2 | run 3 | median |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| generation, 7 tokens | 0.387 | 0.396 | 0.400 | **0.396 tok/s** |
| prefill, 51 tokens | 1.53 | 1.54 | 1.52 | **1.53 tok/s** |
| prefill, 5 tokens | 0.62 | 0.63 | 0.63 | **0.63 tok/s** |

Spread 3.3% on generation, 1.3% on prefill — tighter than this machine usually
manages, and worth recording so the next session knows what counts as a real
move. 8.6 GiB free; 0.85 GiB of the always-read set did not fit and was re-read
every token.

**Where a V4-Flash token goes**, which had never been written down because the
block's single `compute` was buried in the residual of the phase table:

| phase | per token | share |
|---|---:|---:|
| **expert slice read (disk)** | **1.70 s** | **67%** |
| block `compute` — attention, both FFNs | 0.44 s | 17% |
| `tail` — routing, which forces an early compute | 0.40 s | 16% |
| dense binds | 0.01 s | <1% |

**So porting `parallel-experts` here cannot pay, and the ceiling is measured.** A
throwaway build that kept the read and dropped the three routed `mul_mat_id`
calls ran **0.388 against 0.370 tok/s** and moved `compute` by **0.01 s of
0.44** — the whole routed expert arithmetic is **under 5% of a token**, so
perfect parallelisation at zero overhead is worth at most 1.05x.

**The other premise was also wrong.** `read_expert_slices` packs the selected
slices contiguously *as it reads them*, so this path already runs the batched
`mul_mat_id` form — the ~1.02 GB/token gather that killed the Qwen3 version is
here the read that had to happen anyway. No headroom and no mechanism.

**The drive is not the fixable part either.** `chaos-iobench` on a shard of this
model tops out at **2.74 GiB/s at four handles** and does not climb at 8, 16 or
32, so the 8-handle pool is not the limit. The gap to the achieved 1.88 GiB/s is
the **per-block barrier**: nothing can be queued while a block computes, because
what to read next is decided by the routing that block has not produced yet.
Same wall as `v4flash-has-no-slack-2026-08-10.md`, reached from latency instead
of bytes. Full node:
`research/parallel-experts-do-not-transfer-2026-08-16.md`.

## Six declined-flag reasons were wrong, again (2026-08-16)

The declined table drifted twice today and was audited a third time. **Four
reasons had become false and two were incomplete** — and one was never right.

| flag | was | now |
|---|---|---|
| `--split-mode` | "needs `ggml_backend_sched`, which is not wired in" | the scheduler **is** wired in; what is missing is a **second usable device**, which is hardware |
| `--tensor-split` | "needs the same scheduler wiring" | same hardware blocker |
| `--backend-sampling` | "there is no other backend to run it on" | a device exists; sampling is **Rust over a logits vector, not a graph**, and only a graph can be scheduled |
| `--no-host` | "this is a CLI, not a server" | **never right** — llama.cpp's flag bypasses the host buffer; here the default already binds zero-copy with no buffer, so it is a no-op except under `--op-offload` where removing host buffers is a segfault |
| `--poll` / `--poll-batch` | "ggml owns its threadpool here" | ggml **does** expose `ggml_threadpool_new`; not done because `ggml_threadpool_params` carries a fixed-size cpumask and a mistranscribed FFI struct is silent corruption in the path every graph uses |

`--no-host` is the one worth noting: it was not stale, it was a **misreading of
the flag**, sitting in the table that exists to stop exactly that. Checked
against `common/arg.cpp` this time rather than inferred from the name.

**A declined reason is user-facing text and it rots.** Three audits in one day
found six wrong entries between them; anything that changes what the engine can
do should end with a pass over this table.

## Overlapping expert reads does not pay — 1.03x, reverted (2026-08-16)

The phase breakdown after parallel experts looks like an obvious next win: 3.2 s
disk and 1.7 s expert compute of an 8.3 s run, apparently additive, so
arithmetic says ~1.25x.

| | generation tok/s |
|---|---|
| read everything, then compute | 3.19 |
| read chunk k+1 while 0..k compute | 3.28 |

Ahead in 3 of 4 alternating pairs, output byte-identical. **Inside the noise,
and reverted.**

**The arithmetic was wrong because the cache absorbs 64–70% of expert reads.**
"3.2 s disk" is time in the read path, not time waiting on the drive; the
genuinely disk-blocked fraction is perhaps a third of it. And chunking the fetch
gives up read concurrency — `read_slices_parallel` issues a whole block across
eight pooled handles, and four chunks of two cannot reach that queue depth. The
overlap gained and the concurrency lost nearly cancel.

**The measurement nearly did not happen.** The first comparison was
pipelined-now against a *remembered* number from an earlier session, which read
as a large regression and meant nothing — the machine had been running 17 GiB
models for hours and both arms of an unrelated head-to-head were declining
across their pairs. A throwaway toggle was added purely to get both paths into
one alternating session. **This machine drifts by more than the effect; anything
worth under ~10% needs both arms alternating in one session.**

Also measured: the expert cache budget. 2/4/6/8 GiB gives 2.22 / 2.66 / 3.45 /
3.43 tok/s — plateaus at 6 GiB, default already on the plateau, and
`CLAUDE.md`'s "past ~6 GiB the cache is the slowest configuration" does not
reproduce on this model. Full node:
`research/expert-read-overlap-does-not-pay-2026-08-16.md`.

## Parallel experts: 1.29x on expert compute, 1.10x end to end (2026-08-16)

The lead `CLAUDE.md` has named for months — *"llama.cpp peaks at 4 threads where
we peak at 1"* — closed from the other side.

ggml parallelises **within** a node. An expert matmul is a 2048×768
matrix-vector product; split twenty ways that is ~38 rows per thread per
barrier, so the tuner picks one and `-t 20` is 2.4x slower. The batching route
was built and reverted: `mul_mat_id` hit 11.17 GiB/s in the kernel bench, but
making the selected `Arc<[u8]>` experts contiguous costs ~1.02 GB/token — 1.34 →
1.27 tok/s.

**This gathers nothing.** Each expert keeps its own subgraph and its weights
where they already are; N whole experts run side by side with one ggml thread
each, and the partial sums are added in Rust. Parallelism across nodes, the axis
ggml does not offer and Rust does.

Interleaved so a warming page cache cannot look like a speedup:

| workers | 1 | 2 | **4** | 6 | 8 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| generation tok/s | 3.52 | 3.74 | **3.86** | 3.87 | 3.82 |

Four alternating pairs of 1 against 4, spread under 1%: generation **3.52 →
3.86**, expert compute **2.2 s → 1.7 s**. Output byte-identical across 1/2/4/8
workers on three prompts.

**Four is not a core count.** The plateau is 4–6 and falls by 8 because this
model selects eight experts per token; past that there is nothing left to split.
`CHAOS_EXPERT_WORKERS` overrides it, `1` restores the old path exactly.

Scope: **generation only** — the batched prefill path is untouched and measured
flat at 1.30–1.32 across every worker count. 1.10x rather than 1.29x end to end
because expert compute is 33% of a token against disk's 39%. Full node:
`research/parallel-experts-2026-08-16.md`.

## Generation on Qwen3-30B is 0.90x, not 2x behind (2026-08-16)

`CLAUDE.md` has said in bold, for months: *"Generation is still ~2x behind (1.07
vs 2.16) — do not claim otherwise."* **It no longer reproduces.**

Both engines run **alternately in one session**, five pairs, medians:

| | Chaos | llama.cpp | ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| generation tok/s | **3.03** | **3.35** | 0.90x |
| prefill tok/s | **1.22** | **1.17** | 1.04x |

**This does not claim parity and certainly not a lead.** 0.90x is behind, and
the generation ranges overlap almost completely (2.67–3.59 against 2.89–3.69).
What can be said is that the gap is now inside this setup's noise, and that the
specific "2x" figure is dead. Prefill is the tighter comparison: our five runs
span 3%, the reference's span 50%.

Caveats stated rather than buried: short prompt, and by the fifth pair the page
cache is warm. Both engines get that equally because the runs alternate.

**Re-measured after parallel experts landed**, same protocol: medians 3.53 vs
3.25 (1.09x), prefill 1.22 vs 1.25 (0.98x). **Still parity, not a lead** — the
paired count is 3–2, the ranges overlap almost entirely, and both series decline
across the session (3.53 → 3.03 and 3.62 → 2.53), which after hours of
back-to-back 17 GiB runs reads as thermal drift. So the sequence is **0.90x →
parity**, with the 1.10x from parallel experts accounting for the move.

Nothing was aimed at this number. It moved because of everything that landed
since — the `-t`/`-tb` split, `compute()` once per phase, a file handle per
reader, frequency-gated cache admission, R2's overlap and R3's KV cache.

**The rule: re-run the headline before quoting it.** Third retraction here, and
the first that moved a number *in our favour* — which is not better. The
"generation is 2x behind" framing had been steering which work got picked. Full

## The GPU does not help a streaming MoE model — 4.3x slower (2026-08-16)

`-ngl` is a smooth win on a dense model. On the model this project exists for it
is a large loss. Qwen3-30B-A3B, medians of three, spread under 2%:

| | prefill tok/s | generation tok/s |
|---|---:|---:|
| CPU only | 1.30 | **2.61** |
| `-ngl 12` (of 48) | 1.30 | 1.44 |
| `-ngl 48` | 1.09 | **0.61** |

**Not a bug.** 76% of a token is disk, and **the experts run on the host
whatever `-ngl` says** — they stream per block into host memory and their FFN
builds its own CPU context. `-ngl` places only the resident set: 0.93 GiB, about
5% of what a token actually reads. So offloading moves the small part, leaves
the large part, and adds a host round trip for the activation at every one of 48
blocks. Putting the experts on the card is not available either — ~16 GiB
against 5.11 GiB of VRAM, the same wall that made the model stream.

**The rule: a speedup measured on a model that fits does not transfer to one
that does not.** Every GPU number published here — 25.6x on a kernel,
1.33–1.52x on a Qwen3-4B prefill, 1.79x on the `-ngl` frontier — was measured on
a model that fits, and none of them predicted this one.

`chaos-run` warns, with the measurement in the message, when a device is opened
on a model that streams experts. Full node:
`research/gpu-does-not-help-streaming-moe-2026-08-16.md`.

## `--op-offload` works, and it cannot pay yet (2026-08-16)

The scheduled forward pass runs. `--op-offload` is implemented, produces the
same completion as every other path, and is **slower than not using it**.

**The blocking bug was one missing call: `ggml_set_input`.** The scheduler has
an explicit branch — `if (tensor->flags & GGML_TENSOR_FLAG_INPUT) cur_backend_id
= sched->n_backends - 1` — and without the flag a leaf with no buffer, no data
and no op is unplaceable, reaching `ggml_gallocr_allocate_node` as `-1`, which
aborts. It also explains why the CPU must be passed **last**. Found by bisection
in a 60-line test after two wrong guesses (the scratch buffer; the views).

| prompt | plain CPU | `--op-offload` | `-ngl 99` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 11 tokens | 34.23 | 35.04 | 56.93 |
| ~900 tokens | **79.24** | **64.39** | 205.37 |

**The prediction written down first was wrong.** "A long-prefill flag or
nothing" assumed the weight copy happens once per pass. It does not: this engine
submits ~5 graphs per block — ~180 per pass — and the scheduler copies weights
**per submission**, so the copy amortises over a *block*, and prefill length
never helps. llama.cpp submits **one** graph and its copies amortise across all
36 blocks. That is the entire difference. Scheduling also gives up the 1.39x
repack, so the flag starts 19% behind before moving an operation.

**So this is a second, independent argument for
`activations-resident-across-layers`** — the first was 110 graph submissions
costing 0.64 s of allocation on a single prefill. `--op-offload` is the cheapest
test of whether fusing graphs did what it claims.

Ships off by default, printing the measurement when enabled. `ggml_set_input` is
applied on **every** path: marking an input is what it is regardless of who runs
the graph. Full node: `research/op-offload-cannot-pay-2026-08-16.md`.

## The offload frontier is a smooth dial (2026-08-16)

`-ngl` shipped with no performance number, which is a gap: a placement flag
whose effect on speed is unmeasured cannot inform a decision. Qwen3-4B-Q4_K_M,
RTX 3050, **three runs per point, medians**:

| `-ngl` | prefill tok/s | generation tok/s |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 | 43.29 | 6.34 |
| 9 | 48.38 | 6.41 |
| 18 | 54.57 | 6.99 |
| 27 | 63.78 | 7.06 |
| 36 | 66.49 | 7.78 |
| 99 | **77.34** | **8.85** |

Both monotonic, no knee: **1.79x prefill and 1.40x generation end to end**, with
every intermediate point on the line. That is the useful result — `-ngl` is a
dial a user sets from the VRAM they have, not an all-or-nothing switch.

**The single-run version of this table said something false.** One run per point
gave `36: 72.41` against `99: 65.80`, which reads as "offloading the output head
costs something". The three runs at 36 were 63.41 / 66.49 / **81.04** — a 28%
spread, wider than the entire difference being explained. Third time this
project has caught a causal story built on one GPU run, and the first two both
reached a published number.

**This is not the interesting frontier.** The model fits (2.33 of 5.11 GiB), so
every point was a free choice rather than a constraint. The larger-than-VRAM
curve is the one CLAUDE.md names as unpublished by anyone, and `-ngl` is what
makes it sweepable. Full node: `research/ngl-frontier-2026-08-16.md`.

## `--override-tensor`, and the same bug three times (2026-08-16)

`-ot <pattern>=<CPU|GPU>` places named tensors regardless of `-ngl`, which is
how llama.cpp users keep MoE experts off a card that cannot hold them. It reuses
the per-tensor residency `-ngl` introduced, so the flag is mostly a pattern and
two refusals.

**The pattern is a substring with `*`, not a regex, and a regex is refused.**
This workspace has no external dependencies, so a regex engine would be a new
one for a single flag. The refusal is the part that matters: `blk\.(1[0-9])\..*_exps`
treated as a literal matches nothing, the flag appears to work, and the model
loads exactly where it would have anyway — a flag accepted and ignored, which is
what the declined-flag table exists to prevent.

**A rule that splits a single block is refused too, by name.** llama.cpp can put
attention on the card and the FFN on the host inside one layer because its one
graph goes through `ggml_backend_sched`. Here a block's graph runs in exactly one
place, so `*ffn_down.weight=CPU` would build a mixed graph — and that segfaults
rather than failing.

**THE SAME BUG APPEARED THREE TIMES IN ONE DAY, and the third one is the
lesson.** Every instance was a *graph* placed by one rule while its *weights*
were placed by another:

1. `rope_freqs.weight` bound host-side while block 0 ran on the card (`-ngl`).
2. The device duplicate of it keyed on `gpu_layers > 0 && <= n_layer` — true for
   a partial `-ngl`, **false for `-ot`**, which implies a full offload the rules
   then carve into. Seven blocks read a device pointer from the host.
3. `edge_device` never consulted the overrides, so `-ot "*=CPU"` ran the
   embedding on the card over a host tensor.

Each was exit 139 with no error. The fix is structural rather than three
patches: **residency is resolved once at load into `block_placement` and
`edge_placement`, and everything that decides where a graph runs reads those.**
A second derivation of the same fact is what kept being wrong.

`-ot "*=CPU"` now reproduces the pure-CPU completion exactly, which is the
strongest check available for the flag: force everything home and the device
path must vanish.

## `-ngl` runs, and it says the device path was never checked (2026-08-16)

`ggml_backend_sched` is bound and tested. Partial offload works. And the thing
worth carrying forward is neither: **the device path fails 1 of 8 parity prompts
where the CPU path fails none, and nobody had run that comparison.**

`scripts/parity-check.sh` takes `NGL=n` now and passes `-ngl n` to **both**
engines, which is the only honest way to diff a partial offload — the
reference's own answer moves with the split. Llama-3.2-1B, RTX 3050, Vulkan:

| offload | ok | FAIL |
|---|---:|---:|
| `-ngl 0` — both on CPU | 6 (+1 unstable, +1 near-tie) | **0** |
| `-ngl 8` — 8 of 16 blocks on the card | 7 | **1** |
| `-ngl 99` — all of it | 7 | **1** |

So **`-ngl` costs nothing over `--device`** — same score, and a *different*
failing prompt each time, which is a near-tie landing differently rather than a
broken split. The 1-in-8 belongs to `--device`, and it has been there since
Phase A, which was accepted on "it runs and it is 1.73x" with **no completion
diff at all**. The GPU tier is not verified and must not be called finished.

**The first reading of this was wrong.** One prompt swept over `-ngl 0..17` had
us changing at 5 values and llama.cpp at none, which looks exactly like our bug.
Eight prompts reversed it: llama.cpp answers `A triangle has a base of 5 units`
at `-ngl 0` and `a base of 10 cm` at `-ngl 99`, and Chaos flips the *opposite*
way. A CPU kernel and a Vulkan kernel do not produce bit-identical sums and
greedy decoding turns the last bit into a different word — in both engines.

**The scheduler is not what makes `-ngl` work**, and the two changes should not
borrow each other's credit. A mixed *graph* is undefined behaviour; a mixed
*model* is not, because this engine materialises the activation as a host
`Vec<f32>` at every block boundary. The per-block round trip that costs
everywhere else is what makes the split free here. The scheduler becomes
load-bearing when `backlog/activations-resident-across-layers.md` lands.

**One tensor broke the rule and segfaulted.** `rope_freqs.weight` carries no
`blk.` prefix but every block reads it, so hosting it while block 0 ran on the
card was a mixed graph: exit 139, no error, every `-ngl` from 1 to 16 dead while
0 and 17+ passed. It is bound on both sides now. **A tensor every block reads
must exist on both sides of a split** — it is the only one today, and a new
architecture that adds another will fail identically.

**Two near-misses, both invisible to the harness.** `CLAUDE.md`'s `GGML_LIB_DIR`
points at a ggml build with **no Vulkan archive**, and the GPU tests *skip*
rather than fail without a card — so `6 passed` was reported for a file whose
two GPU tests had never run, and the scheduler commit's first draft claimed a
mixed graph had computed when it had not. And `splits() >= 2` was asserted on a
**single-node** graph, which cannot split however its operands are placed: an
unfalsifiable assertion, only revealed when a real card started evaluating it.

**The 1-in-8 turned out to be arithmetic, measured the same day.** `chaos-gpubench`
grew `--prompt <text>` and a real comparison — the old one was
`sum(|logits[0..64]|)` to four decimals, which is what Phase A's "logit
checksums agree" rested on and cannot see the top token move. On all eight
parity prompts the device picks the **same first token**; the kernels disagree
by **0.37–0.71** (mean 0.06–0.09) and the model's own top-2 margin falls to
**0.399**, so on `Dear Sir or Madam` the difference is 94% of the margin. Within
a 32-token continuation some position has a margin under 0.4 and the token
flips. **A wiring bug does not agree on 8 of 8** — and this is why a text diff
is not a valid acceptance test for a GPU path in any engine, which llama.cpp's
own 2-in-8 flip rate was already saying. Still unproven either way: whether our
spread is larger than llama.cpp's, which needs its logits rather than its text.

## R12 — the 256-token V4-Flash context cap is gone (2026-08-11)

**Supersedes the "V4-Flash is capped at 256 tokens of context" entry under Known
limitations.** Issue #46. Detail:
`docs/graph/research/ring-wraparound-2026-08-11.md`.

The raw KV latents were `kv_lora_rank * 256` per layer **indexed by absolute
position**, so position 256 wrote past the end. They now live in a 1024-slot
ring; the compressed half grows. The container declares
`context_length = 1048576` — the cap was ours.

**The only limit left is on one pass: 897 tokens**, which chunking satisfies
(`-b` defaults to 256). The error reports the batch limit rather than a sequence
limit, because chunking is what a caller can act on.

Why a ring is exact, and where it would not be:

| structure | indexed by | fix |
|---|---|---|
| `raw` | absolute position | **ring**, `position % 1024` — sound only because raw attention is *sliding* (`attention.sliding_window = 128`), so a position older than the window can never be read again |
| `comp` | **block** index | **grows; cannot be a ring** — the compressed half is visibility-limited, not windowed, so every complete block behind a token stays reachable |
| compressor input ring | `pos0`-relative | already correct, untouched |

`sliding_window = 0` would mean full causal attention, where a ring would
silently drop keys still in scope; that case is refused rather than served.

The ring size is the **window plus the batch**, not the window: a pass's
*earliest* query still reaches `window - 1` behind `pos0`. Measuring from the
last query instead would drop exactly the keys the first rows of a prefill need.
45 MB across 43 layers, against 11 MB before.

The mask was rewritten with it, as the cache's own comment said it would have to
be — the key axis is no longer the slot index but a gathered run of absolute
positions, and handing the mask slot indices would attend to whatever `p % 1024`
held.

Verified with the R3 equivalence harness past the old cap — `prefill(0..=257)`
against `prefill(0..257)` + `step(257)`:

```
past 256: argmax 91 agrees; sums 350740.59 vs 352047.19 (0.373% apart)
```

Not bit-identical, deliberately: routing flips on near ties when the batch shape
changes. 22 container-backed tests pass at 2, 5, 165 and 258 tokens — which is
Raw, CSA and HCA, since prompt length decides which builder runs. `raw_span` is
a pure function with unit tests covering wraparound, the batch limit and the
property the whole design rests on: no two positions in one span share a slot.

~~**Still stale, and not mine to change**: `chaos-serve.rs` reports
`context_limit() = 256` for deepseek4, so the server refuses sequences the engine
now handles. One line, and it belongs to whoever owns that file.~~

**CLOSED 2026-08-11 in `9f024e7`, merged at `7a81502`** — it reports 897, the
per-pass cap. Recorded because of *how* this nearly went wrong: the note above
outlived the fix, and a later session repeated "still reports 256" from the note
instead of reading the file. **A stale note reads exactly like a current fact.**

## StableLM and StarCoder2: one shared blocker (2026-08-11)

Both downloaded, run and diffed. **Neither is verified.** They fail for the same
reason, which is why the work is scoped as a feature and not as two models:
`docs/graph/backlog/layernorm-and-biases.md`.

```
stablelm -> ??地なutorsemie路emieemieا起
```

The qwen2 CJK-noise signature. What is missing, after #60's Q/K/V bias support:

1. **`chaos-ggml` has no LayerNorm.** It binds `ggml_rms_norm` and not
   `ggml_norm`. LayerNorm subtracts the mean and carries a **bias**; RMSNorm
   does neither. The tell is `attn_norm.bias` in the container, and the metadata
   key being `attention.layer_norm_epsilon` rather than `..._rms_epsilon`.
2. **Biases beyond Q/K/V.** #60 added `attn_bias` (Q/K/V, detected from
   `blk.0.attn_q.bias`). StarCoder2 also needs `attn_output.bias`,
   `ffn_up.bias` and `ffn_down.bias`.
3. **Partial RoPE.** `rope.dimension_count` is ignored — `head_dim` is passed as
   `n_rot` unconditionally. StableLM declares **16 of its 64** dimensions, so its
   rotation is wrong today. **This is a real bug beyond StableLM**: any container
   declaring the key is currently over-rotated.
4. **Ungated FFN.** StarCoder2 has no `ffn_gate` — plain MLP with GELU rather
   than SwiGLU. `FfnAct` (added by #60) is where an ungated variant belongs, and
   `ctx.gelu()` now exists.

LayerNorm plus biases is also the shape of falcon, gpt2, gptneox, bloom, phi2
and starcoder, so building it once moves the count by more than these two.

Ruled out: the tokenizer (both declare `gpt2`, supported) and the RoPE
convention (both NeoX, already mapped). The failure is entirely in the block.

## StarCoder2 verified; StableLM is one tokenizer line away (2026-08-11)

**`VERIFIED_ARCHITECTURES` is nine** — `starcoder2` added, 3/3 exact on
`parity-check.sh`. StableLM is **not** added; its block is right and the
remaining difference is in the tokenizer.

What the dense path gained, all detected from the container rather than by name:

- **LayerNorm.** `chaos-ggml` now binds `ggml_norm` beside `ggml_rms_norm`.
  A norm carrying a bias *is* a LayerNorm — RMSNorm never centres and has no
  shift — and substituting one was the fluent CJK noise both models produced.
- **The full bias set.** `attn_output`, `ffn_up`, `ffn_down` and the norms,
  on top of the Q/K/V biases.
- **Partial RoPE.** `rope.dimension_count` was **ignored entirely**;
  `head_dim` went in as `n_rot` unconditionally. StableLM rotates 16 of its 64.
  This was a real bug beyond StableLM — any container declaring the key was
  over-rotated.
- **Ungated FFN.** `down(gelu(up(x)))` when there is no `ffn_gate`.

**Two traps, both caught by the reference and not by an error:**

1. **A bias that is not in `required_tensors` is never loaded**, and the graph
   then silently skips it — `weights.get` returns `None` and the shift is simply
   not applied. StableLM read *almost* right for exactly this reason. The
   easiest to miss is `output_norm.bias`: applied once, so a wrong final norm
   shifts every logit by the same vector and the text stays fluent.
2. **A missing `ffn_gate` means two different things.** Phi-3 fuses gate and up
   into one tensor twice `n_ff` wide; StarCoder2 has no gate at all. Testing for
   the tensor alone made Phi-3 ungated and **broke a verified architecture** —
   caught by the regression sweep, which is why it runs. The shape separates
   them.

**StableLM: the block is correct, the tokenizer is not.** Two of three prompts
match exactly; `def fibonacci(n):` tokenizes to **4 tokens where llama.cpp makes
5**, so the prompt differs before a single weight is read. The cause is ours and
recent: `tokenizer.ggml.pre` is **absent** in that container, and
`Tokenizer::from_metadata` falls back to `"llama-bpe"` where llama.cpp's default
is the plain GPT-2 rule. A6c refused every unknown `pre` **by name** and then
guessed the absent case, which is the same mistake one layer down.

The fix is a `default` GPT-2 variant in `pretok.rs` plus one line in
`crates/chaos-tokenizer/src/lib.rs` — a file another session owns, so it is
reported rather than taken.

Regression sweep after these changes, `parity-check.sh` at 32 tokens: gemma2,
gemma3, qwen3-4b, qwen2, tinyllama, starcoder2 all 3/3; llama32-1b and phi3 2/3
plus one `unstable`, which is llama.cpp disagreeing with itself on a near-tie
and is documented. 411 workspace tests, clippy and fmt clean.

## StableLM verified — the absent pre-tokenizer was guessed (2026-08-11)

**`VERIFIED_ARCHITECTURES` is ten.** `stablelm` added, 3/3 exact.

The block had been right since LayerNorm landed; the last difference was the
**tokenizer**, and the bug was ours and recent. When `tokenizer.ggml.pre` is
**absent**, `Tokenizer::from_metadata` fell back to `"llama-bpe"`. llama.cpp
falls back to its `LLAMA_VOCAB_PRE_TYPE_DEFAULT` GPT-2 rule.

```
llama-tokenize  "def fibonacci(n):"  ->  def / ' fibonacci' / ( / n / '):'   5
chaos, before                       ->                                      4
chaos, after                        ->                                      5
```

A6c refused every *unknown* `pre` **by name** and then quietly guessed the
**absent** case — the same mistake one layer down from the one it fixed.

**The default is structurally unlike the other variants**: four regexes applied
in **sequence**, each splitting what the last produced, rather than one ordered
alternation. The first pass cuts a run of punctuation out *whole and first*, so
`(n):` becomes `(` `n` `):` before anything else runs. That single pass is the
entire disagreement.

**It also narrows a claim made an hour earlier.** `starcoder2` was verified 3/3
while running this same wrong fallback — it declares no `pre` either, and only
agreed because its merge table differs from StableLM's. It was re-run after the
fix and is still 3/3, so the entry stands; but "verified" meant less than it
looked at the time, and the re-run is what makes it mean what it says.

Containers affected: any `gpt2`-BPE container omitting the key. Of those on
disk, `stablelm` and `starcoder2`. Everything that declares its `pre` explicitly
— qwen2, qwen3, llama32-1b, v4flash — is untouched and re-checked unchanged.

Regression sweep after the fix: stablelm 3/3, starcoder2 3/3, qwen2 3/3,
qwen3-4b 3/3, gemma2 3/3, llama32-1b 2/3 + one documented `unstable`.
414 workspace tests, clippy and fmt clean.

## Eight prompts instead of three: three bugs, two of them in "verified" code

`ticket/r14-architectures`, 2026-08-11. Four architectures were on the list —
olmo, falcon3, internlm2, baichuan. Three of them needed almost nothing. The
harness change that preceded them is what earned the session.

**`VERIFIED_ARCHITECTURES` is thirteen**: baichuan, deepseek4, gemma2, gemma3,
internlm2, llama, olmo, phi3, qwen2, qwen3, qwen3moe, stablelm, starcoder2.

### The three bugs, all pre-existing on `main`, all confirmed by stashing

| bug | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `rope_freqs.weight` never read (Llama-3.1/3.2/3.3) | 3 ok / 4 unstable / 1 FAIL | **8 ok** |
| no BOS for a BPE container that declares none (Falcon3) | 1 ok / 5 unstable / 2 FAIL | **8 ok** |
| USER_DEFINED token byte-decoded instead of copied | newlines vanished | **byte-exact** |

The first is the serious one. Llama-3.1 onwards carry `rope_scaling = "llama3"`
as a **tensor** — `rope_freqs.weight`, `n_rot/2` per-frequency divisors, handed
to `ggml_rope_ext` as `freq_factors`. We passed `None`. The metadata reports
`rope scaling = linear, freq_scale_train = 1` whether or not the tensor exists,
so nothing announces it; llama.cpp's only sign is one debug line. `llama` has
been in `VERIFIED_ARCHITECTURES` the whole time.

It needed two changes, and the second is the trap: the tensor had to be added to
`required_tensors()`, or it is **never loaded**, `weights.get` returns `None`,
and the rotation is quietly the un-extended one. Same shape as StableLM's
missing biases.

### The rule those bugs cost

**"The reference disagrees with itself" is not a safe verdict.** The harness
re-runs a mismatch under `-fa off` and `--no-repack` and calls the prompt a
near-tie if llama.cpp's answer moves. That compares the reference *to itself*. It
cannot see that **our input differed** — and when it does, a near-tie is exactly
the symptom, because the model is answering a slightly different question.

**Nine of the eleven `unstable` verdicts in this session were bugs.** One near-tie
in eight is ordinary; five is a bug not yet found.

Also fixed in the harness: `llama-completion` prints ` [end of text]` on EOS and
Chaos prints no equivalent, so any model terminating early read as a FAIL whose
two sides were identical (`chaos: 42` vs `llama.cpp: 42 [end of text]`).

### What the four architectures actually needed

- **olmo** — one real feature: **non-parametric norms.** llama.cpp builds every
  one as `build_norm(x, NULL, NULL, LLM_NORM)`, and the container holds no
  `attn_norm.weight`, `ffn_norm.weight` or `output_norm.weight`. `layer_norm` and
  `norm_bias` had to split into two booleans — they were one because every
  LayerNorm so far had a bias, and OLMo made the loader demand an
  `output_norm.bias` that cannot exist. Also: **`olmo` was listed as NeoX RoPE
  with `known = true`** while llama.cpp lists it in the NORM branch. A guess
  wearing the label of a checked fact.
- **internlm2** — 8/8 first run; only needed the NORM RoPE entry.
- **baichuan** — 8/8 on the 7B. **The 13B is now refused**: llama.cpp gives it
  ALiBi by *layer count* (`n_layer == 40`), the two share a tensor set and an
  architecture name, and the 13B would load, rotate keys it should not, and
  answer fluently.
- **falcon3** — **not a new architecture.** It converts to `llama`, and `falcon3`
  is one more alias in llama.cpp's `llama-bpe` arm. Everything it exposed was in
  shared code. Its container is also the reason `gpt-2` and `default` are now
  separate pre-tokenizers here: they are separate entries in llama.cpp
  (`PRE_TYPE_GPT2` is one regex, the `default:` arm wraps it in three more
  passes) and `from_name` had mapped `gpt2` onto `default`.

### Scoreboard, one session, one build, `parity-check.sh <model> 32`

```
OLMo-1B.Q4_K_M                    8 ok  NEW    Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct        8 ok

```

426 workspace tests, clippy `--workspace --all-targets -D warnings` clean, fmt
clean.

**Not done**: the `clamp_kqv` path (MPT/DBRX/OLMo) is written against
llama.cpp's code, not a run — OLMo-1B declares `0.0`. Phi-3's two unstable
prompts are unexamined, and after nine `unstable` verdicts turned out to be bugs,
"it was already like that" is a weak defence. Containers live at
`C:/Projects/models/{olmo,internlm2,falcon3,baichuan}/` and are the only copies
on this machine.

## The GPU tier, scoped before any code — and the guessed slice does not survive

`research/gpu-tier-smallest-honest-slice-2026-08-11.md`, 2026-08-11. Written as
a scoping node on instruction, with no GPU code attached.

**The hypothesis was "N dense layers resident in VRAM, experts still streamed to
host". Measured, it fails twice.**

| model | always-read (dense) | routed experts | verdict |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| DeepSeek-V4-Flash-UD-Q4_K_XL | **7.38 GiB** | 137.06 GiB | **does not fit** 6.0 GiB of VRAM |
| Qwen3-30B-A3B-Q4_K_M | 0.93 GiB | 16.35 GiB | fits, with nothing worth moving |

For V4-Flash the dense half is larger than the card, so that variant needs a
mixed-device graph and a `ggml_backend_sched` — the *largest* possible first
slice. For Qwen3-30B it fits with 5 GiB spare, but of 5.4 s accounted in a
measured run the entire dense path is **9%** (disk 52%, expert compute 37%). A
**1.10x ceiling**, below the 1.4x already unclaimed in R2's overlap.

Moving the *expert* matmuls instead addresses 37% but pushes ~1.15 GiB/token
over PCIe — the same shape this project already built and reverted (contiguous
experts, ~1.02 GB/token, byte-identical output, **1.34 → 1.27 tok/s**), with a
bus added.

**Blocker (a) is worse than this file recorded.** It is not "needs a
CUDA-enabled ggml": there is **no CUDA toolkit on this machine at all** —
`nvcc` absent, no `ggml-cuda.a` — only a CUDA-capable driver (610.74).

**Blocker (b) is one line.** `crates/chaos-ggml/src/weights.rs:286` writes a
host pointer into `tensor->data`. `ggml-cuda` cannot be handed one; a device
tensor is filled by a copy. So a GPU path is a second `bind_shared` plus a
scheduler, not a flag.

**The slice that does survive: VRAM as a read cache in front of the disk,
computing nothing.** It never binds a device tensor, so blocker (b) is
sidestepped rather than solved; it needs the CUDA runtime rather than a second
ggml build; and its failure mode is *slower*, not *wrong*, which is the only GPU
change with that property. It pays where VRAM is a meaningful fraction of the
expert bank — 31% of Qwen3-30B's 16.35 GiB, **3.6% of V4-Flash's 137 GiB** — so
the 20–70 GiB class, not the model this project talks about most.

**Recommended next action is not a GPU ticket.** Sweep tok/s against host cache
size first: the VRAM tier's value is a point on a curve that does not exist yet,
and if the curve has already flattened, the tier is dead for the same reason the
byte-reduction roadmap closed. That sweep needs no toolkit and no new code.

PCIe bandwidth in that node is labelled arithmetic, not measurement — it cannot
be measured until the toolkit is installed.

## The tok/s-versus-RAM frontier, measured — and it says no GPU ticket

`research/ram-frontier-qwen3-30b-2026-08-12.md`, 2026-08-12. The first
published curve of generation speed against **owned** cache size for a model of
this class. It can be swept at all only because this engine is told how much RAM
to use; `mmap` cannot be asked for exactly N GiB.

Qwen3-30B-A3B, `--cache` 1→12 GiB, `-n 16`, five interleaved rounds, medians,
free RAM sampled on every row.

| `--cache` | tok/s | vs 1 GiB | streamed | evictions |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 GiB | 0.78 | 1.00x | 12.13 GiB | 1758 |
| 2 | 1.62 | 2.08x | 9.34 | 1957 |
| 4 | 1.85 | 2.37x | 6.69 | 1286 |
| **6** | **2.63** | **3.37x** | **5.53** | **0** |
| 8 | 2.56 | 3.28x | 5.53 | 0 |
| 10 | 2.13 | 2.73x | 5.53 | 0 |
| 12 | 2.56 | 3.28x | 5.53 | 0 |

**Rises to 6 GiB, flat after: 3.37x for 6 GiB of owned residency.** It flattens
for a *capacity* reason the engine reports directly — at ≥6 GiB `evictions` is
**0** and `streamed` is 5.53 GiB, which is what 16 generated tokens of this
prompt distinctly touch. Below it the same run re-reads what it already had.

**The 8/10/12 rows are a free null** — provably one configuration, so their
16.8% median spread is the noise floor. Nothing above 6 GiB is distinguishable;
the 1→6 climb is far outside it.

### Two methodological findings that outlive the numbers

**A wrong activation is a wrong residency benchmark.** Fixing GELU-for-SiLU on
this model moved streamed bytes **7.00 → 5.53 GiB** and hits 80% → 70%, because
different FFN outputs become different router inputs and select **different
experts**. The pre-fix sweep measured a different workload. Do not benchmark a
cache on an unverified model.

**The free-RAM column is not decoration.** A first attempt had an entire round
flattened by this session's own git work releasing memory — visible only as free
RAM *rising* 8.7 → 10.4 GiB mid-round. Without the column it would have been
folded into the medians.

### Verdict for the VRAM tier

**No GPU ticket, now measured rather than argued.** The flat region already fits
in this machine's 9–10 GiB of free RAM, so VRAM adds nothing on this model. 5 GiB
of VRAM is 31% of Qwen3-30B's expert bank and **3.6% of V4-Flash's** — neither is
the window where a second tier changes the shape.

But **where the curve flattens is a property of the workload, not the hardware**:
it saturates at 5.53 GiB because that is what 16 tokens touch, and distinct
expert bytes grow with generation length. The frontier is a *surface* in (cache
size, tokens generated) and only one slice of it exists. That slice is the next
measurement, and it is not a GPU ticket either.

**Caveats, stated in the node:** one prompt, one machine, one session; `-n 16`;
round-over-round drift of ~25% with free RAM stable and the cause unidentified;
and **Qwen3-30B-A3B is not in `VERIFIED_ARCHITECTURES`** — it was delisted the
same day for a remaining stable-reference divergence, and it is the only
container here in the size class where the curve is interesting.

## The knee moves with `-n` — the slice above was the flattering one

`research/the-knee-moves-with-n-2026-08-14.md`, 2026-08-14. The measurement the
section above asked for: the second axis, 3 rounds × `-n` {16, 64, 256} ×
`--cache` {1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12}, interleaved on both, free RAM every row.

**The working set grows with what you generate.** Read off the `evictions = 0`
rows, where `streamed` is the whole distinct working set:

| `-n` | working set | first budget with 0 evictions | best tok/s |
|---|---|---|---|
| 16 | 5.53 GiB | 6 | 3.13 |
| 64 | 7.05 GiB | 8 | 4.38 |
| 256 | 10.14 GiB | 12 | 4.70 |

So **"the frontier is flat after 6 GiB" was a statement about sixteen tokens.**
At 256 the knee is 12 GiB and tok/s is still climbing there — it had not
flattened by the largest budget swept. Growth is strongly sublinear (16× the
tokens, 1.83× the set, ≈`n^0.22`), but it extrapolates a 2048-token generation to
**~14–18 GiB of expert cache on a 15.7 GiB machine**. The honest product claim
is *the largest model at the speed you want, **for the length you generate***.

**More cache made it slower at identical work.** At `-n 16`, budgets 6/8/12 read
the same 5.53 GiB, hit the same 70% and evict nothing — byte-identical work — and
run 3.13/3.02/2.91. That is 7% lost to memory the OS could have used: the
page-fault-wearing-a-hit's-disguise effect, measured under control rather than
inferred, and invisible to the hit counter. It appears only where the budget
*exceeds* the working set; at `-n 256` more is monotonically better.

**Two methodological results.** `streamed`, `hit%` and `evictions` were
**bit-identical across all three rounds** — the workload is deterministic and
only wall-clock moves, which is what makes 18 cells from 2 clean rounds
trustworthy. And **contamination is a property of the period, so discard the
round, not the row**: round 1 ran at 0.25 tok/s where the clean rounds agree on
2.48, and a naive "free ≥ 4 GiB" row filter still admitted a row showing 7.45
GiB free that ran 5× slow.

Same caveats as the slice it extends, plus one more: the sweep needs `--force`,
because **`qwen3moe` refuses to run without it** — 0 FAIL but 6 of 8 prompts
unstable under the widened harness.

## `unstable` was answering the wrong question — 6 of 8 is really 2 of 8

**2026-08-15, and it corrects the line directly above.** The harness classified a
disagreement by asking *"does llama.cpp disagree with itself here?"* and the
report read as though that settled *"is Chaos's output one of the things it
disagrees between?"* Those come apart precisely where it matters, and **the nine
of eleven `unstable` verdicts that turned out to be real bugs were all the second
kind**. Same model, same prompts, same build, with the two separated:

| | |
|---|---|
| `ok` — matches the default | **2** |
| `near-tie` — reproduces one of llama.cpp's *own* no-op outputs **byte for byte** | **4** |
| `unstable` — a **third** answer it never gives | **2** |

**Four of the six were never unexplained.** So the evidence for a defect in the
`qwen3moe` path is **2 of 8, not 6 of 8** — below the cluster threshold rather
than absent, and the harness now exits 0.

**The variation is the evidence, more than the count.** Which configuration we
land on is not constant: `-b 1` twice, `-fa off` once, `-b 1 -fa off` once. A
systematic defect would be systematic — quietly running batch-1 semantics would
reproduce `-b 1` on *every* such prompt. Three different configurations across
four prompts is what a real near-tie looks like. **So the discriminator is a
diagnostic and not only a verdict:** a *constant* answer would name the behaviour
we share, and would be the lead.

Two prompts are still outside the band. `Q: What is 17 plus 25? A:` was examined
first because arithmetic has a right answer, and **it came back the opposite way
to the guess**: Chaos emits `42`, exactly as every reference configuration does.
The earlier "it skips the answer" reading was an artefact of capturing the two
sides with different tail-truncation. It was flagged as not citable before anyone
acted on it, which is the only reason it cost nothing.

The reference spans **three distinct outputs across five configurations** on that
prompt — `42`, `A: 42` on its own line, and `17 + 25 = 42` — so the continuation
after the answer is barely determined at all. Chaos is a fourth, agreeing with
`-fa off` at the token where the reference splits. **That is weak evidence of a
defect, not strong**: the bugs this harness has caught (Llama-3.2's RoPE,
Falcon3's short prefill) broke prompts that had a determined answer, and this one
gets the determined part right. `research/parity-band-discriminator-2026-08-15.md`
carries the full table.

The threshold moved without moving: three-in-eight still fails, but on the
sharper class, which is *stricter* — everything excusable has been taken out of
it. And a bound was added the other way, because every configuration added widens
the band and "in band" gets cheaper as the probe grows: six ties in eight now
fails too.

## The GPU tier, step 1: the card works — 25.6x, and it is llama.cpp's number

`research/gpu-the-card-works-vulkan-not-cuda-2026-08-15.md`, 2026-08-15.

**GPU is still 0%.** Nothing here is Chaos. This is the precondition the ticket
set — *if llama.cpp cannot use the card, we cannot either* — answered in an hour
rather than three days, which is what step 1 was for.

**CUDA is not installable here without a toolchain migration.** `nvcc` on Windows
supports only MSVC as its host compiler, and this machine has **no MSVC at all**,
while everything the project builds with is MSYS2 mingw64 (`cc.exe`, `c++.exe`,
`cmake.exe`, gcc 16.1.0). The CUDA route is: install Visual Studio Build Tools,
build `ggml-cuda` with MSVC, then link an MSVC static library into a **GNU-target**
Rust binary — against the `.cargo/config.toml` workaround `CLAUDE.md` says not to
delete. That is a decision, not a step 1.

**ggml's Vulkan backend compiles with the compiler already in use.** Eight MSYS2
packages, verified first not to touch gcc/binutils/CRT; the driver already shipped
the loader; built into a separate `build-vulkan` so the 507 tests keep pointing at
the CPU ggml. `-D_WIN32_WINNT=0x0A00` is required — vendored `cpp-httplib` calls
`::CreateFile2` from `common`, so `-DLLAMA_BUILD_SERVER=OFF` does not avoid it.

Qwen3-4B-Q4_K_M (2.32 GiB, fits VRAM), llama.cpp `daef2b3`, one session, `-r 2`:

| config | pp512 | tg128 |
|---|---:|---:|
| CPU, 20 threads | 79.65 ± 5.93 | 3.65 ± 0.10 |
| CPU, 4 threads | 40.25 ± 0.95 | **6.39 ± 0.08** |
| **RTX 3050, `-ngl 99`** | **2042.60 ± 5.52** | **56.53 ± 0.04** |
| Intel iGPU, `-ngl 99` | 38.13 ± 2.09 | 3.26 ± 0.03 |
| RTX 3050, `-ngl 0` | 497.82 ± 243.16 | 3.42 ± 0.08 |

**Against the best CPU configuration of each: prefill 25.6x, generation 8.8x.**

**Two rules, not footnotes** — this project has retracted a competitive claim
before. **(1) The baseline must come from the baseline's build.** `-ngl 0` on a
GPU build is the GPU backend with nothing offloaded, not the CPU path: it reads
3.42 tg128, *below* the real CPU 6.39, with a ±49% error bar on prefill, and
quoting it buys a fake 16x. A disabled accelerator is not a control.
**(2) Tune the baseline before you beat it.** `llama-bench` defaulted to 10
threads, which is wrong for both phases; against that default this would have
read 30.1x instead of 25.6x.

**Our `-t`/`-tb` finding reproduces on the reference.** Prefill 40.25 → 79.65
going 4 → 20 threads, generation 6.39 → 3.65 going the other way — the same two
levers pulling opposite ways, at the same crossover, on llama.cpp's own binary.
That is independent confirmation of the threading work, not a quirk of our
scheduler.

**The Intel iGPU is not a second tier, and it is the attractive idea.** It has
more free memory than the discrete card (7387 vs 5233 MiB) and `uma: 1`, so the
upload problem would not exist there — and it runs 0.48x the CPU on prefill and
0.51x on generation. It has no matrix cores and it shares the DRAM the CPU path
already saturates: **a UMA device removes the copy, not the bottleneck.** Full
node: `research/the-igpu-is-not-a-tier-2026-08-15.md`.

**Blocker (b) is untouched and is still the whole ticket.** A Vulkan tensor is
filled by `ggml_backend_tensor_set`, which copies, exactly as CUDA would. Vulkan
removes an MSVC migration from *in front of* the work; it does not touch the work.
And 76% of a token on the MoE path is disk, which no GPU fixes — the 25.6x above
is prefill on a model that fits in VRAM, the one slice this card can plausibly win.

## The GPU tier, Phase A: the card runs a full prefill — at 1.33–1.52x

`research/phase-a-device-prefill-2026-08-15.md`, 2026-08-15. Chaos's own binary
runs a complete Qwen3-4B prefill on an RTX 3050 through Vulkan, every weight
resident on the card.

```bash
chaos-gpubench C:/Projects/models/qwen3-4b/Qwen3-4B-Q4_K_M.gguf --repeat 3
```

| | cpu (`-t 20`) | device | ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| median | 52.68 tok/s | 80.02 tok/s | **1.33–1.52x** across invocations |
| range | 48.84–59.93 | 73.09–80.27 | warm-up discarded |

Logit checksums agree (625.01 vs 621.17), so it is the same answer, faster.

**Two figures from the same day are retracted, and the second one reached a
merge-commit headline.** `#68` merged as "…at 1.73x"; that came from one prefill
per process. **The repeat harness says 1.33–1.52x and that is the number.** An
earlier 0.42x was a cold Vulkan pipeline cache — the driver persists compiled
shaders to disk, so run 1 of any GPU path is a different program from run 2.

**Two rules came out of it, both now enforced by `chaos-gpubench` itself.**
A GPU measurement needs **repeats** — `--repeat 1` is refused without `--force`.
And **nothing expensive belongs inside the timed region**: the first harness
reloaded 2.32 GiB per run and swung the CPU baseline 26.48–67.35 tok/s, a 2.5x
spread that buried the effect being measured.

**Where the device time goes**, measured per operation rather than attributed:
compute 1.80s over 110 graph submissions, upload 1.04s, download 0.66s, device
allocation 0.64s over 110 allocations. Transfers are 36% and allocation 14%, so
half the device's time is structural overhead rather than arithmetic.

**This is not a differentiator and STATUS must not claim it is.** llama.cpp does
2042 pp512 on the same card and model with the same ggml underneath, because it
runs one graph for the whole pass with no host round trips. We submit 110. The
gap is our design, not the kernels — `backlog/activations-resident-across-layers.md`
sizes closing it at 2.5–3x, still far short of llama.cpp.

**`ggml_backend_sched` is mandatory for Phase C, proven not assumed**:
`research/mixed-residency-segfaults-2026-08-15.md`. And Phase C's ceiling is
revised **down** from 1.3x — that estimate assumed the compute moved for free,
and Phase A shows it does not.

## The architecture count overstates the work, and here is the evidence

**2026-08-16.** Three containers downloaded to verify three "new" architectures.
Two of them declare `llama`:

| container | `general.architecture` | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 | **`llama`** | 8/8 exact — but verifies `llama`, already on the list |
| Yi-1.5-6B-Chat | **`llama`** | same family, same path |
| gemma-1.1-2b-it | `gemma` | **8/8 twice — genuinely new, now verified** |

**A GGUF names an architecture, not a model family.** Mistral, Yi, Vicuna,
Zephyr, TinyLlama, WizardLM and most fine-tunes all ship as `llama`, so they run
today and always did. "12 of 141" counts llama.cpp's *dispatch arms*, and a
large share of the models people actually run funnel through a handful of them.

That does not make the 141 wrong — those arms are real and some are genuinely
different models. It makes **the bar a poor proxy for coverage**, and it means
the honest question is "does the model you have run?", not "how many arms are
implemented".

**Mistral's first run failed with `梦梦梦梦…` and llama.cpp emitted nothing.**
That was a corrupt download — two fetch processes resuming into one file, 4973 MB
against an expected ~4370 MB — not a forward-pass bug. **Two engines failing the
same container is a file problem**, and the size said so before any debugging
did. A clean re-download passed 8/8.
