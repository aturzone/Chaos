//! The Win32 surface this app uses, declared by hand.
//!
//! Every item here is something Windows already ships in `user32`, `gdi32` or
//! `kernel32`. Declaring them is mechanical; taking a GUI crate instead would
//! add more code to the dependency graph than the whole rest of this workspace
//! contains, and the reason a Chaos binary starts on a machine with no runtime
//! installed is that it links almost nothing.
//!
//! Only what is called appears below. An unused `extern` declaration is a
//! promise about a symbol's signature that nothing ever checks.

// The names are Windows' own. `HWND` renamed to `Hwnd` would read better and
// would also stop these declarations matching the documentation they are
// checked against, which is the only review this file can get.
