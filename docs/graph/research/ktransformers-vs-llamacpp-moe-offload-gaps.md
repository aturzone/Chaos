## Findings

### Gaps in ktransformers itself
- Source build frequently fails on consumer setups: CMake "CUDA compiler not found" (must export `CMAKE_ARGS="-DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER=$(which nvcc)"`), missing `libhwloc-dev`, requires `GLIBCXX_3.4.32`+ (conda-forge `libstdcxx-ng`), old CMake breaks CUDA20 dialect flags. Issue #1104 "Unable to install ... CMake exit code 1": https://github.com/kvcache-ai/ktransformers/issues/1104 ; Issue #1022 wheel build failure: https://github.com/kvcache-ai/ktransformers/issues/1022
- Maintainers' own 2026 Q1 roadmap lists "improve installation experience for new users" as a still-open target, plus a CLI (model mgmt/benchmark/quant) as not-yet-done, AMD perf as needing work, and prefill optimization as "help wanted": https://github.com/kvcache-ai/ktransformers/issues/1779
- Windows support is second-class: native Windows only landed Aug 2024; install.bat failures reported ("system cannot find the file specified", issue #109: https://github.com/kvcache-ai/ktransformers/issues/109); no official Windows binary with Vulkan yet (open request, issue #1173: https://github.com/kvcache-ai/ktransformers/issues/1173)
- Primary tuning surface is hand-authored YAML `optimize_rule` injection files: regex `match`/`replace` pairs per module (e.g. `^model\.layers\..*\.self_attn$`) that pick which C++/CUDA kernel replaces which PyTorch module. No GUI/wizard; requires reading source to write correctly: https://github.com/kvcache-ai/ktransformers/blob/main/doc/en/injection_tutorial.md
- DeepSeek weight prep needs an extra offline step: a conversion script turns FP8 GPU safetensors into INT4-quantized CPU weights before the model can load at all — one more manual stage vs. llama.cpp's single-GGUF workflow.
- Expert-placement auto-tuning exists but is narrow: `kt-expert-placement-strategy` (uniform vs threshold) and `kt-enable-dynamic-expert-update` (redistributes GPU-resident experts using live routing stats during prefill) live only in the newer kt-kernel component, need extra VRAM headroom (~9GB+ for Kimi-K2-Thinking, ~3.6GB for MiniMax-M2.1), and are documented as most effective only in a 10–70% GPU-expert-ratio band — not a general "pick my split" solver: https://github.com/kvcache-ai/ktransformers/blob/main/kt-kernel/README.md
- The `kt run <model>` "auto-optimized parameters" CLI command is mentioned only as a one-line CLI overview entry; its actual selection logic is undocumented, so it can't be verified as reliable: https://github.com/kvcache-ai/ktransformers/blob/main/kt-kernel/README.md
- No monitoring/observability of any kind found: the concurrent-serving doc (balance-serve.md) has zero mentions of metrics, logs, Prometheus, or dashboards: https://github.com/kvcache-ai/ktransformers/blob/main/doc/en/balance-serve.md
- Continuous batching (chunked prefill, multi-concurrency) only shipped in v0.2.4 via the new `balance_serve` backend — a >10,000-line rewrite, so it's young. Known bug: issue #1074 — balance_serve appears to lose/not reuse KV cache between prompts, causing a >1 minute stall on a 154-token follow-up after a 12,116-token prompt (vs. immediate response on the older backend); unresolved at report time: https://github.com/kvcache-ai/ktransformers/issues/1074
- balance_serve install is invasive: "installing this project will replace flashinfer in your environment" (fresh conda env strongly recommended), needs its own compile flags (`USE_BALANCE_SERVE=1`, plus `USE_NUMA=1` for dual-socket) on top of the base install, and requires `cache_lens > max_batch_size * max_new_tokens` bookkeeping the user must get right: https://github.com/kvcache-ai/ktransformers/blob/main/doc/en/balance-serve.md
- kt-kernel's documented hardware floor skews server-grade (AVX2/Haswell-2013+ CPU baseline, Ampere/RTX-3000+ for AMX-adjacent paths for full feature set); the README does not address budget/small-team consumer builds directly: https://github.com/kvcache-ai/ktransformers/blob/main/kt-kernel/README.md

### Gaps in llama.cpp
- `--n-cpu-moe N` (moves first-N MoE-tensor layers to CPU) counts layers from the highest-numbered layer, which desyncs from where dense/shared layers actually live in DeepSeek-V3-style architectures (dense layers up front) — users must know this quirk to size the split correctly; `--override-tensor` gives finer control but needs hand-written regex per tensor, with no generator/wizard: guide at https://huggingface.co/blog/Doctor-Shotgun/llamacpp-moe-offload-guide , gist https://gist.github.com/DocShotgun/a02a4c0c0a57e43ff4f038b46ca66ae0
- Community guide's own advice is trial-and-error: "Inspect your VRAM usage on each model launch and adjust accordingly," and explicitly states the auto-fit feature isn't good enough yet to remove this step ("perhaps in the future ... once the auto-fit feature is fully optimized"): https://huggingface.co/blog/Doctor-Shotgun/llamacpp-moe-offload-guide
- The newer `--fit`/`--fit-target`/`--fit-ctx` automation (built on PR #16653 + `llama-fit-params` tool, design discussion https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/18049) is real and merged but young, with open correctness issues as of mid-2026:
  - Overflows past a 4095 MiB target on Windows: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/20308
  - Not yet "authoritative" — needs better failure handling, per-device validation, OOM-risk probing, UMA accounting: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/22592
  - Measurably slower prefill/decode with `--fit on` for fused gate+up MoE checkpoints (e.g. Qwen3.5-35B-A3B quant): https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/20492
  - Can't reduce context length without also forcing CPU/host tensor offload: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/22442
  - Only one global memory-margin target, no per-device margin: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/18390
- No persistent GPU cache for CPU-offloaded experts: every decode step re-copies the same ~4 hot experts per layer from RAM to GPU and discards them afterward. Open feature request #20757 proposes a pluggable-eviction two-tier GPU+RAM expert cache (SLRU default); a Python prototype hit 12–14 tok/s vs 0.5–1 tok/s pure-CPU once warm — i.e. a known, unimplemented, large perf gap for exactly the consumer MoE-offload case: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/20757
- Batch-size (`-b`/`-ub`) tuning competes with MoE offload for the same VRAM budget with no arbitration: prompt-processing perf is "very sensitive to prompt processing batch size," and raising it may force reducing how many expert layers fit on GPU: https://huggingface.co/blog/Doctor-Shotgun/llamacpp-moe-offload-guide
- NUMA handling on dual-socket/many-channel RAM boxes (a common cheap-per-GB build for MoE CPU offload) is explicitly "not handled elegantly" by llama.cpp itself — needs external wrapper scripts/env tuning: https://huggingface.co/blog/Doctor-Shotgun/llamacpp-moe-offload-guide
- `/metrics` (Prometheus, off by default via `--metrics`) exposes only generic serving counters — `llamacpp:prompt_tokens_total`, `tokens_predicted_total`, `predicted_tokens_seconds`, `requests_processing`, `n_busy_slots_per_decode` — nothing about per-expert activation counts, routing skew, or MoE-cache hit rate: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/tools/server/README.md
- Aggregated metrics across multiple backend instances in router mode is itself an open, unshipped request (Discussion #19197): https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/19197
- Concurrent-request scaling is comparatively weak per one architecture write-up: llama.cpp's slot-based queuing reportedly produced ~44x less aggregate throughput than vLLM at 64 simultaneous users — a real ceiling for small-team multi-user use even before MoE CPU-offload is added (secondary/blog source, not primary — lower confidence): https://contracollective.com/blog/vllm-vs-llama-cpp-batching-production-inference-2026

### Gaps common to both
- Neither exposes MoE-specific observability: no per-expert activation/routing metrics and no cache-hit-rate metric for the CPU↔GPU expert-transfer path, in llama.cpp's `/metrics` or in ktransformers' balance_serve docs. A solo operator can't directly see whether their offload split is hot-path-efficient — only infer it from tokens/sec.
- Both require manual, hardware-specific tuning to split a MoE model across VRAM/RAM, and neither has a mature general solver: llama.cpp's `--n-cpu-moe`/`--override-tensor` is trial-and-error by the community guide's own description, and its newer `--fit` auto-tuner still has open correctness bugs (Windows overflow, non-authoritative failure handling, MoE-model slowdowns — see above); ktransformers' equivalent is hand-authored YAML `optimize_rule` files or the narrow kt-expert-placement-strategy, scoped to specific models/VRAM bands.
- Both have open, current GitHub issues about batching/cache correctness for MoE-offloaded serving specifically: llama.cpp #20757 (no persistent expert cache, redundant PCIe copies every decode step) and ktransformers #1074 (balance_serve loses/doesn't reuse KV cache between prompts, >1 min stalls). This is active-development territory in both projects as of mid-2026, not solved.
- Both effectively require from-source builds to get the fastest path for a given machine (llama.cpp: CUDA/ROCm/Vulkan backend selection at compile time; ktransformers: CMake+CUDA+AVX512/AMX detection) — prebuilt binaries lag the source tree, so a solo user chasing the newest MoE-offload feature routinely hits toolchain errors (the "CMake/CUDA compiler not found" class of issue appears in both trackers).
- First-party documentation for CPU/GPU MoE-offload tuning is thin in both; the best references are community-authored (Doctor-Shotgun's llama.cpp MoE-offload guide/gist; ktransformers' equivalent knowledge is scattered across README, kt-kernel README, and separate tutorial docs) rather than a single official quick-reference — a small team has to synthesize best practice from community writeups either way.

## Open questions
- Whether llama.cpp's `--fit` reliably handles DeepSeek-V3/R1-class (671B, MLA) MoE architectures specifically, vs. the smaller Qwen3/GPT-OSS cases seen in the issues found — not directly confirmed either way.
- Whether ktransformers' `kt run` "auto-optimized parameters" is production-ready or still experimental — mechanics undocumented in the README.
- No first-party or independent benchmark found directly comparing solo-user experience (time from clone to first token) between the two projects on identical consumer hardware — only piecemeal community reports and blog posts.
